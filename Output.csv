"# Academic and Career Plan

With Academic and Career Plan , districts set up clusters, programs, and credentials offered by academic year, as well as enter the reimbursement needed for Academic and Career Plan credential testing for each academic year. Once set up, schools and their teachers manage declared Academic and Career Plan programs, courses, and earned credentials for their students.

Academic and Career Plan is focused on developing the skills of K-12 students by preparing them for postsecondary learning and workforce opportunities. Academic and Career Plan courses encourage students to explore and prepare for careers in agriculture, criminal justice, health science, hospitality, and more. Programs of study are organized by career clusters, which include distinct groupings of occupations and industries based on the knowledge and skills they require. Students enrolled in a program where career and technical skill proficiencies are aligned with industry-recognized standards can work towards industry credentials. The credential provides proof that the student possesses the minimum skills required for entry-level employment. The following is an example of career tech data:

```
""Cluster Type"",""Agriculture, Food & Natural Resources""

"# General Import/Export File Rules
* Import and export files do not support/include IDs (primary or foreign).
* The order of the rows does not matter.
* Flags (columns that begin with ""is"") are booleans and can be set as the following:
    * Positive: indicate as (case insensitive alphas): true, t, 1, yes, y, or blank
    * Negative: indicate as (case insensitive alphas): false, f, 0, no, or n
* Column name localization is supported.
* Import only supports insert, not update or delete. Any updates or deletions are completed within the UI.# Academic and Career Plan: Setup
* Columns are specified (import)/selected (export) from the following tables:
    * Cluster (+ any extensions), ClusterType \*,
    * Program (+ any extensions), ProgramType \*,
    * Credential (+ any extensions) CredentialType \*"

* You can import:
    * Cluster/ClusterType only
    * Cluster/ClusterType & Program/ProgramType
    * Cluster/ClusterType, Program/ProgramType and Credential/CredentialType
* Import is hierarchical:
    * Must have a Cluster to import a Program
    * Must have a Cluster and Program to import a Credential
* You are responsible for creating appropriate data for the import.
* There is column size limit validation for names (100 characters) and codes (5 characters).
* Associations between tables are made based on each row in the file.
    * Types and their parents (For example, ClusterType and Cluster).
    * Association tables ClusterPrograms and ProgramCredentials are populated based upon the import row.# Export Business Rules
* Export can be hierarchical depending on the columns selected.
    * It will be hierarchical if you export all columns, 
    * It is not hierarchical if you only select ProgramName and ProgramCode, 
* YearID is the only built-In filter and is necessary to retrieve records.
    * YearID can be entered as the PowerSchool YearId (For example, 29) or 2019. 

    * PowerSchool YearID is calculated starting at year 1990, so 1990 + 29 = 2019."

* Only one ""isHomeDistrict"" import row value can be set to true.
* Rows that have a SchoolNumber column value are considered to be a home\_district school.
    * SiteName is not required in this instance since the persisted SiteName will be ""school\_site\_###"", where ### is the DCID (the SchoolNumber is used to find SchoolDcid).
    * Address information is ignored.

* If address columns are specified, only non-home\_district column values will be added to the Site table. The value for State will be identified in the CodeSet table to get the StatesCodeSetId and CountryCodeSetId.# Export Business Rules

"# Attendance Synchronization

On this page:

Districts that switch from using Daily to Meeting attendance or vice versa during the school year will have attendance records that are out of synch. For instance, during the time period that the district took Daily attendance, Meeting attendance records are missing. Use the automated attendance synchronization process to rebuild the missing attendance records.

Processing Options
------------------

The synchronization process has two processing options:

* Based on existing Daily attendance records, Meeting attendance records will be created.
* Based on existing Meeting attendance records, Daily attendance records will be created.

Setup
-----

Prior to running the synchronization process, several setup options are required:

* Attendance recording methods – The current method used by the school for recording attendance, as this is the method that will determine the bridge direction (currently taking Daily, so need to retroactively build Meeting OR currently taking Meeting, so need to retroactively build Daily).
* Meeting and Daily Attendance Bridge – Either one-way or two-way sync must be selected:
    * One-way indicates that when a Meeting attendance record is taken during the bridge period, a Daily attendance record is automatically created.
    * Two-way is the same as one-way but also indicates that when a Daily attendance record is taken, a Meeting attendance record is automatically created for the bridge period.
* Bell Schedules – Each bell schedule used in the school's calendar must have a bridge period defined, including default time in and time out.


Other System Requirements
-------------------------

* System Backup – It is strongly recommended that you back up your system prior to running this process.
* School Year – The synchronization process may not be run for school years prior to 2004-2005.
* Current School Only – The synchronization process may only be run for the current school and may not be run for the district office.

Synchronize Attendance
----------------------

1. On the start page, choose System under Setup in the main menu. 
2. Under Attendance, click Attendance Bridge Synchronization. 
3. Select the Direction to re-build bridge:
    * Choose From Meeting, build Daily to create a daily attendance record for each meeting attendance record that exists for the calendar day's bridge period.
    * Choose From Daily, build Meeting to create a meeting attendance record for each daily attendance record that exists for the calendar day. 

4. Select Other Preferences:
    * If daily attendance code is absent, mark all periods absent for the day to create a meeting attendance record for each period in the bell schedule.
    * If daily attendance code is absent, mark only the bridge period absent for the day to create a meeting attendance record for the bridge period identified in the bell schedule.

"# Recalculate Daily Attendance

Under certain circumstances, you may need to recalculate the daily attendance minutes. These circumstances may include updating from a previous PowerSchool release or changing the attendance preferences that affects Daily Time Exclusion (DTE). Once this special function is generated, all daily attendance record minutes for each student are updated based on DTE attendance preferences for each school's full year term. 

Note: This special function should be generated after regular business hours, but not during nightly processing. The duration of the special function depends on how many daily attendance and associated Attendance\_Time records exist. Run this special function only under the following conditions: no attendance activity is occurring, including recording or importing of attendance records; and no attendance reports are currently running.

1. On the start page, choose Special Functions under Functions in the main menu. 
2. Click Attendance Functions. 
3. Click Recalculate Daily Attendance Minutes.

"# Attendance Code Categories

Attendance code categories are used to group attendance codes by classification, beyond Present or Absent, for reporting and searching purposes. Use the Attendance Code Categories page to view, add, delete, or edit the attendance code categories used at your school.

Note that attendance code categories are the one exception to year-specific data. Attendance code categories are a constant and should not be deleted from any year that uses them.

Tardy and Excused attendance code categories are set up by default and should not be deleted. In order for an attendance code to count as tardy, the attendance code must be associated to the attendance code category of Tardy. In order for an attendance code to count as excused, the attendance code must be associated to the attendance code category of Excused. Similarly, if you create other attendance code categories, in order for an attendance code to count as the attendance code category, the attendance code must be associated to that attendance code category.

Note: Attendance code categories are not used to group attendance codes by Present or Absent. All attendance codes are categorized as Present or Absent when creating the attendance code via the Attendance Code page. 

After creating attendance code categories, proceed to creating attendance codes. Attendance must be set up completely before taking attendance in PowerSchool.

"# Full-Time Equivalencies
Attendance calculations support full-time equivalencies (FTEs). FTEs are a powerful tool used in schools that need to associate groups of students with different attendance values for the same day, for example, full-time and half-time students.

FTEs are also used to determine default settings for reporting on Average Daily Attendance and Average Daily Membership (ADA/ADM). These settings include the default attendance mode and their conversion types. For Meeting, you can choose Percent Period to Day, Percent Time to Day, Period to Day, or Time to Day. For Daily, you can choose Code to Day, Percent Time to Day, or Time to Day. And, for Interval, you can choose Time to Day. FTEs are school- and year-specific, but will be duplicated when new years are created.

Using Full-Time Equivalencies (FTE) page, you can set up and use FTEs to indicate what portion of a school day students attend.

Note: If this is the first time you have accessed the Full-Time Equivalencies (FTE) page, you will notice an FTE of 1 was created. This is to maintain backwards compatibility, as previously PowerSchool assumed students were full-time."
"# Set Students' FTEs
Once attendance is set up, you will need to set students' FTEs for school enrollments via the student Transfer Information page.

FTE is a grouping that associates a student's school enrollment with a set of attendance conversion values. When ADA runs, for a student, it runs for each school enrollment during the report dates. When processing each school enrollment, it uses the student's FTE to locate the set of attendance conversions to use when looking up the attendance value for the day. 
For more information, see Transfer Information.# Work with FTE Codes

"# Attendance Conversions

On this page:



Set up attendance conversions to calculate attendance. You can create multiple attendance conversion methods, such as Full Day or Half Day. For example, a student receives only a half-day of attendance credit if he or she is absent for two to four periods and receives no credit if absent for five or more periods. After creating attendance conversions, set up attendance conversion items. 

View Existing Attendance Conversions
------------------------------------

To access existing Attendance Conversions, choose School from the main menu, then select Attendance Conversions.

The name of the Full-Time Equivalent (FTE) shows ?. Students with one FTE can have a different set of conversions than students with a different FTE.

The types of attendance conversion items you can create or edit include:

* Period - Use to define the number of periods in which the student must be present/absent to receive the number of points ADA value you define.
* Code - Use to define the full-day ADA value you want a student to receive when a specific attendance code is given.
* Time - Use to define the cut-off points for attendance and the ADA value a student should receive at each.
* Percent Period - Use to define the percent of periods in which the student must be present/absent to receive the number of points ADA value you define.
* Percent Time - Use to define the percentage of time for which a student must be present/absent to receive the number of points ADA value you define.

One of the following displays for each attendance conversion item entry:

* Defined – Indicates attendance conversion items have been defined.

"# Attendance Indicator

On the PowerSchool SIS Teacher portal start page, a dot appears next to each class' Chair icon. The color of the dot indicates whether or not the teacher has taken attendance for that class. A clear dot indicates attendance has not been taken. A yellow dot and fraction indicates partial attendance has been taken. A green dot indicates attendance has been taken.

To provide you with flexibility, you can customize the attendance indicator images by replacing them with graphics of your own. You can switch these images as often as you like. For example, you may want to switch your images seasonally by using such images hearts, four-leaf clovers, autumn leaves, or snowmen.

Customize the Attendance Indicator
----------------------------------

1. Determine the replacement images.
2. Name the replacement images accordingly:
    * For the image that indicates that attendance has not been taken (clear dot), use attendancetaken\_no.png.
    * For the image that indicates that partial attendance has been taken (yellow dot), use attendancetaken\_some.png.
    * For the image that indicates that attendance has been taken (green dot), use attendancetaken\_yes.png.

"# Section Attendance Settings

Use the Section Attendance Settings page to create sections where attendance will be taken every period. These sections are sections created for the sole purpose of taking attendance in a section that meets more than once per day. For example, if a section of Biology 101 meets during Period 1 for lecture during each day of a two-day cycle and also meets during Period 3 for field study on alternating days, the expression for this section would be 1(A-B) 3(A). If you do not use this option, attendance taken during 3(A) will overwrite attendance taken during 1(A).

Define Section Attendance Settings
----------------------------------

Perform the following procedure to create sections where attendance will be taken every period and either your school has committed a master schedule with sections or sections are created from the School Setup page.

1. On the start page, choose School under Setup in the main menu.

"# Attendance Tracking Methods
The Percent attendance tracking method must be set up with a threshold to properly track attendance, even if only tardies are tracked. Attendance tracking methods are used to track unexcused attendance. There are no tracking methods for illness. Illness by default uses the Year method seen in the table below.

Once the Percent tracking method is set up, additional tracking methods can be set up to be used in conjunction with Percent.

The following tracking methods are available:

```
""Tracking Method"",""Description""
""Percent (Required)"",""The percentage of the day the student can miss due to unexcused absence attendance.The Percent method is calculated as ‘greater than’ the value set for the threshold. For example, if you enter 50 for the threshold, the student must be absent more than 50% of the school day in order to be reported.For example, for a four period day, the student would need to miss more than two periods due to unexcused absence.""
""Tardy Day"",""The number of periods the student can be assigned an unexcused tardy.The Tardy Day method is calculated as greater than or equal to the threshold. For example, if you enter one for the threshold, the student must be counted as unexcused tardy for one or more periods in order to be reported.""
""Consecutive"",""The number of consecutive days the student can miss due to unexcused absence in a year.The Consecutive method is calculated as greater than or equal to the value entered for the threshold, and is combined with the Percent method.For example, if the Percent threshold is 99 and the Consecutive threshold is three, then the student must miss more than 99% of three consecutive school days during the school year to be reported.""
""Semester"",""The number of days the student can miss due to unexcused absence per semester.The Semester method is calculated as greater than or equal to the value entered for the threshold, and is combined with the Percent method.For example, if the Percent threshold is set to 50 and the Semester threshold is set to four, then the student must miss more than 50% of four school days during the semester in order to be reported.""
""Year"",""The number of days the student can miss due to unexcused absence per school year.The Year method is calculated as greater than or equal to the value entered for the threshold, and is combined with the Percent method.For example, if the Percent threshold is set to 75 and the Year threshold is set to seven, then the student must miss more than 75% of seven school days during the school year in order to be reported.Note: The year method is not available as an option when creating levels, and is used for reporting purposes only. The Percent method calculates using the year by default, so use of the Percent method alone can be used for reporting on a year basis.""
""Period/Intervals"",""The number of periods or intervals a student can miss in a day due to an unexcused attendance. In order for this method to function as expected, the Meeting attendance mode must be selected as the “Default attendance page” via Start Page > School Setup > [Attendance] Preferences. The Meeting attendance mode must also be selected for the student’s Full Time Equivalency (FTE) via Start Page > School Setup > Full-Time Equivalencies. FTEs are assigned to students via Start Page > Student Search > Transfer Info > Edit Enrollment.Note: This method cannot be configured to track attendance in a specific period or section. Once the student is identified as meeting the threshold for any period in the day, the method does not count additional periods.""
""Trimester"",""The number of days the student can miss due to unexcused absence per Trimester.The Trimester method is calculated as greater than or equal to the value entered for the threshold, and is combined with the Percent method.For example, if the Percent threshold is set to 50 and the Trimester threshold is set to four, then the student must miss more than 50% of four school days during the Trimester to be reported.""
""Quarter"",""The number of days the student can miss due to unexcused absence per Quarter.The Quarter method is calculated as greater than or equal to the value entered for the threshold, and is combined with the Percent method.For example, if the Percent threshold is set to 50 and the Quarter threshold is set to four, then the student must miss more than 50% of four school days during the Quarter to be reported.""
""Calendar Month"",""The number of days the student can miss due to unexcused absence per Calendar Month.This method is calculated as greater than or equal to the value entered for the threshold and is combined with the Percent method.For example, if the Percent threshold is set to 50 and the Calendar Month threshold is set to four, then the student must miss more than 50% of four school days during the Calendar Month in order to be reported.""
""Calendar Week"",""The number of days the student can miss due to unexcused absence per Calendar Week.This method is calculated as greater than or equal to the value entered for the threshold and is combined with the Percent method.For example, if the Percent threshold is set to 50 and the Calendar Week threshold is set to four, then the student must miss more than 50% of four school days during the Calendar Week in order to be reported.""

"# Illness Tracking Levels

Illness tracking levels can be used to report when a student reaches a defined number of illness absences (thresholds) for multiple instances (triggers). For example, you may want to track the first time a student reaches five illness absences, as well as the second time (ten absences) and third time (fifteen absences).

By default, illness levels use a Percent tracking method with a threshold of 99 and a timeframe of one full school year.

Each time a student reaches a threshold, a notification record is created in the database. Multiple records may exist per day if the student reaches a threshold for more than one attendance tracking level. These records can be used in reports to identify students who have reached illness attendance thresholds.

Note: If a tracking level is changed, the records in the database are not automatically updated. If the district must change a level because of new requirements, it is recommended to create a new tracking level.

Example: Illness Absences
-------------------------

By default, illness levels use a Percent tracking method with a threshold of 99 and a timeframe of one full school year.

Based on the table below, a notification record is created in the database when the student misses more than 99% of three, six, and/or nine school days during the school year. A total of four records are created, one detail record for each instance, plus a summary record.

"# Attendance Tracking District Setup

Once you have set up basic attendance, you can then define the following attendance tracking and notification settings for your district:

* Attendance Tracking Methods
* Unexcused Tracking Levels
* Illness Tracking Levels

The Percent attendance tracking method must be set up for the district. Additional attendance tracking methods are optional. Unexcused and illness levels are also optional."
"# Unexcused Tracking Levels
Unexcused tracking levels are used to expand on the attendance tracking methods and thresholds. Tracking levels are optional.

For example, if you set up the tracking method Percent with a threshold of 50% and Semester with a threshold of five, you can track when a student is absent more than 50% of five school days during the semester.

Using tracking levels, you can report when the student reaches a defined number of unexcused absences (thresholds) for multiple instances (triggers). For example, you may want to track the first time the student reaches five unexcused absences, as well as the second time (ten absences) and third time (fifteen absences).

Each time a student reaches a threshold, a notification record is created in the database. Multiple records may exist per day if the student reaches a threshold for more than one attendance tracking level. These records can be used to print attendance letters for students who meet or exceed attendance thresholds.

Note: If a tracking level is changed, the notification records in the database are not automatically updated. If the district must change a tier because of new requirements, it is recommended to create a new tracking level. Optionally, the District may choose to clear all records for the level."

"# Basic Attendance Setup

Attendance Tracking and Notification requires that PowerSchool attendance is set up to accurately calculate attendance and membership. The attendance setup elements that directly affect Attendance Tracking and Notification are:

Attendance Code Categories for Attendance Tracking
--------------------------------------------------

Attendance code categories are used to identify types of attendance. The attendance codes associated to a particular category must either be absent codes or present codes. For example, you must set up an attendance code category to track unexcused absences, and all of the codes assigned to the category must be absent codes. The default Unexcused category set up in PowerSchool is designed to track unexcused absences and can be used for attendance tracking and notification. Alternatively, if you want to track unexcused absences separately for different reports, then you must set up two unexcused absence categories, one for attendance tracking and notification and one for other purposes.

If you want to track unexcused tardies in attendance tracking and notification, you must set up an unexcused tardy attendance code category. Note that tardies are considered present, thus all codes assigned to the Tardy attendance code category must be present codes. In order to track both unexcused tardies and unexcused absences, you must have a separate attendance code category for each.

Once attendance code categories are set up, these code categories must be associated to the appropriate attendance codes and attendance tracking category, in order to properly track attendance.

For information about associating attendance code categories with attendance tracking categories, see Unexcused Tracking Categories or Illness Tracking Categories. 

For more information about attendance code categories, see Attendance Code Categories.

Attendance Codes for Attendance Tracking
----------------------------------------

Attendance codes are used to assign an attendance to a student for a particular day, section meeting, or interval. For example, you may set up attendance codes such as Unexcused Absence (UE) and Illness Absence (IL).

Once attendance codes are set up, these codes must be associated with the appropriate attendance code category. If you track both unexcused tardies and unexcused absences, you must assign one category or the other to an attendance code, but not both. If an attendance code is considered both an unexcused absence (absent) and an unexcused tardy (present), then two attendance tracking records are created from one attendance code assigned to the student.

Note: For most attendance reports, attendance status is determined by the presence status (Present or Absent) of the attendance code. For attendance tracking and notification reports, however, the presence status is ignored. Instead, the student's status is determined by the unique settings used for attendance tracking.

For more information about attendance codes, see Attendance Codes.

Basic Attendance Setup Summary
------------------------------

* Attendance codes must be set up.
* Attendance codes must be associated with the appropriate attendance code category.
* Attendance code categories must be set up to identify types of attendance.
* Separate attendance code categories must be set up for unexcused tardies and unexcused absences.
* Attendance code categories must be associated with attendance tracking categories."
"# Attendance Tracking and Notification

Attendance Tracking and Notification can be used in combination with the basic PowerSchool attendance setup. The additional setup elements allow for tracking of truant attendance using a combination of thresholds and triggers. Each time a student meets or exceeds a specific threshold, a notification record is created in the PowerSchool database. The notification records can be used to print attendance letters for students with truant attendance.

For example, you may set up your school to track unexcused absences. Using basic PowerSchool attendance, you can report the total number of unexcused absences for a student for particular period of time. Using attendance tracking, you can report when the student reaches a defined number of unexcused absences (thresholds) for multiple instances (triggers). In this example, you may track the first time the student reaches five unexcused absences, as well as the second time (ten absences) and third time (fifteen absences).

Remote Attendance
-----------------

All calculations for Attendance Tracking and Notification will consider attendance for classes taken at a remote school. Rules regarding remote attendance:

* Both schools must record attendance in either Meeting-Period-To-Day (MPTD) or Meeting-Time-To-Day (MTTD).
* Both schools must be set up to use ATN.
* All calculations are based on the attendance settings defined at the students 'home' school regardless of the settings defined at the remote school.

For example, school A is the student's 'home' school and ATN is configured to use Meeting – Period to Day (MPTD). All calculations for this student would be based on the attendance conversion set up for Period attendance at School A.

State Reporting
---------------

Refer to your state- or provincial-specific help for additional information on attendance tracking and notification setup."
"# Refresh Attendance Tracking Data Report

The Refresh Attendance Tracking Data report creates Attendance Tracking records for students with truant attendance. The purpose of the report is to identify attendance that requires administrative or parental attention, such as excessive unexcused absences, unexcused tardies, or illness absences. Once this information is calculated and stored in the PowerSchool database, it can be used when printing attendance letters.

Note: It is recommended to complete the Refresh Premier Attendance Views Data process before running this report. To access this function, navigate to Attendance Functions from the Special Functions menu and select Refresh Premier Attendance Views Data.

The Refresh Attendance Tracking Data report performs the following processes:

Detail Record: The report creates one detail record for each truant attendance instance. There may be multiple detail records per student per day if the school uses Meeting attendance. The detail record types are:

* * A (absent)
    * T (tardy)
    * I (illness)

Summary Record: The report creates one summary record for the student for the day, if the student has a detail record for that day. The summary record types are:

* * TA (absent)
    * TT (tardy)
    * TI (total illness)

Notification Record: The report creates a notification record for the student if he/she has enough truant attendance records to require parent notification, such as if the student's records meet or exceed an attendance tracking threshold (set up at the District).

For example, you may track unexcused absences. At the school level, you set up an attendance code category named Unexcused Absence (UA), and you choose Meeting-Period-to-Day (MPTD) as the attendance mode used for attendance tracking and notification.

With this setup, the report creates a detail record for each attendance record associated with the UA attendance code category. Next, the report creates a summary record for each day where the student has a detail record. Finally, the report creates a notification record if the student's detail records meet or exceed an attendance tracking threshold, based on the MPTD attendance mode.

Note: This process must be completed prior to reports that require attendance tracking and notification data, including Truancy and Attendance Letters.

Run the Refresh Attendance Tracking Data Report
-----------------------------------------------

This report must be run at the district level. To run the report, choose System Reports under Reports in the main menu and then click Refresh Attendance Tracking Data. 

1. Select the Processing Option.

2. Enter a date and time to run the report on a specific day or at a specific time. 

3. Click Submit.

"# Reports for Attendance Tracking

There are three Attendance Tracking and Notification reports, which must be run in the following order:

1. Refresh Attendance Tracking Data – used to update attendance tracking and notification records in the PowerSchool database.

2. Truancy and Attendance Letters (View Only and Extract) – used to view dates that students received truant attendance. The Extract version of this report can be used to print attendance letters for parents and/or guardians.

3. Truancy and Attendance – Levels Reached Report – used to view dates that attendance letters were sent to a student's parent, as well as dates that student truant attendance was cleared (excused)."
"# Truancy and Attendance Letters Report (View Only and Extract)

Use the View Only version of this report to review the dates that students received truant attendance that requires parental notification – the date that attendance met or exceeded the threshold of an attendance tracking level.

Use the Extract version of the report to record the date that the parent was notified (the date the report completes, usually the current date). This date represents the date that the attendance letter was printed and sent to the students' parents or guardians. Setting the ""date extracted"" cannot be reversed, so it is recommended to verify data using the View Only version before running the Extract version.

The View Only version of this report produces the first output below. The Extract version of this report produces both of the following two outputs:

* A list of students who meet or exceed a specified threshold for an attendance tracking level. This output includes the ability to immediately access a student in the list by clicking the student's name.
* An attendance letter to be printed via a ReportWorks report. 
    Note: 
    ReportWorks must be set up prior to accessing reports. For more information, see the ReportWorks Setup and Administration Guide.

The first time you run the extract for each attendance tracking level and trigger, all records are returned that meet the level and trigger. Subsequently, records are only returned if they met level and trigger since the last time the extract was run.

Note: You must run the Refresh Attendance Tracking Data report before the Truancy and Attendance Letters report.

Run the Truancy and Attendance Letters Report
---------------------------------------------

Both the View Only and Extract versions of this report must be run at the school level. To run the report, choose System Reports under Reports in the main menu and then click Truancy and Attendance Letters (Extract/View).

1. Select the Grades you want to include in the report.

2. Choose the Extraction Type.

3. Select the attendance tracking level.

"# Backfill Setup

To get started, configure the following setup items in the order by which they appear:

* Enable Backfill Management
* Configure Backfill Preferences

Enable Backfill Management
--------------------------

By default, Backfill is not enabled. Once Backfill is enabled, Backfill functionality appears throughout PowerSchool, including:

* Access to the Backfill Management page.
* Certain aggregation necessary to support backfill will occur whenever attendance is recorded in the system
* Three additional attendance categories, Unexcused Absences, Excused Absences, and Suspensions will be created, if they are not already existing, that are necessary to support backfill reports.

1. On the start page, choose School under Setup in the main menu. 
2. Under Attendance, click Backfill Preferences. 
3. Select the CA Continuation School Backfill Enabled checkbox to enable Backfill Management. 
    Note: To disable Backfill Management, deselect the CA Continuation School Backfill Enabled checkbox. 

4. Configure backfill preferences. 

5. Click Submit. 


Configure Backfill Preferences
------------------------------

Once you have enabled Backfill, you can then configure backfill preferences to indicate how you want backfilling to be processed.

1. Select Realtime Backfill Enabled to apply backfill whenever attendance is recorded in the system. Alternatively, you can run a separate backfill process on a regular basis and keep this option turned off.

2. Choose the Program to Backfill.
3. Update the Target Hours per Day in Week to tell the system the maximum number of hours per week that can be claimed toward ADA funding.
4. Update the Maximum Work Experience Hours per Day in Week.
5. Enter the Backfill Start Date to let the system know how far back it should look when investigating for weeks that need backfill hours to achieve the maximum that can be claimed for ADA. This date should be changed whenever reports are produced, especially auditing reports or P1, P2 and P3 reports for the state, so that the backfill process does not change attendance for weeks that have already been reported. It is recommended that the backfill start date be set to the beginning of each reporting period, ensuring that the backfill start date is synchronized with the actual reporting periods.
6. Enter the Backfill End Date to let the system know the date on which the backfill will no longer be applied. Typically this field is left blank to indicate the current date or is set to the end of the school year. If entering a backfill end date, it is recommended that the backfill end date be set to the ending of each reporting period, ensuring that the backfill end date is synchronized with the actual reporting period.

7. Click Submit. "
"# Clear Backfill

If you are performing the three-step backfill process, the first function to run after you have made your student selection is the Clear Backfill function to clear backfilled attendance for all selected students.

6. Click Submit. "
"# Manage Backfill

You can run Backfill as a separate process using Backfill Management. There are certain situations that can occur during Realtime Backfill that mandate using Backfill Management. Specifically, attendance being changed for a week in which backfill was already applied or student's being withdrawn from classes in the middle of the week can result in backfill calculations being incorrect. The proper way to ensure that the calculations are correct and that all backfill has been applied for the backfill period is to run the Validate Backfill function. This function performs these three tasks:

* Corrects any miscalculations that may have occurred due to attendance changes made to weeks that already had backfill applied.
* Corrects any orphaned backfilled records caused by student's withdrawing from classes or withdrawing from the continuation education program.
* Performs the backfill process for any students who may not have had backfilled applied. This typically occurs if the option for Realtime Backfill has not been enabled in the school's attendance preferences page.

The Backfill process must be run whether or not Realtime Backfill has been enabled to ensure that calculations have been correctly applied for all students. The process performs quickly if Realtime Backfill is enabled, since only exception students are recalculated. If Realtime Backfill is not enabled or has not been used during the backfill period, the backfill process calculates backfill for each student who has enrolled in the continuation education program during the backfill period.

When running the Backfill process, you have two options. The first option is to run the Validate Backfill function, which runs all three tasks of clearing backfill, regenerating attendance aggregation, and running backfill in succession for all students in the selected school. The second option is to run the three tasks separately, which allows you to run the process for all or a selected group of students to perform corrections and problem diagnosis.

Note: Backfill should be run prior to running the California's Alternative Education reports, see the California State Reporting Attendance and Membership Report Guide available on PowerSource.

"# Backfill Management

Backfill is a process that specifically supports the California's Alternative Education Program for Continuation Education. For more information about California's Alternative Education Program (CA AEP), visit PowerSource.

Backfilling maximizes the number of attendance hours that can be claimed for state funding by taking excess hours from a school week and applying those hours to a prior week in which the maximum hours were not achieved. There is a set number of hours per week that can be used towards ADA funding. Once this maximum is reached the state allows any additional hours to be used in previous weeks in which a student did not attend for the maximum. Hours can only be backfilled to previous weeks. Hours cannot be used for future weeks. There are numerous rules regarding backfilling and how hours can be claimed.

Backfill can be applied when attendance is taken by enabling Realtime Backfill. Backfill can also run as a separate process using Backfill Management. "
"# Daily Time Exclusion Calculation Rules

The following rules apply only if a student is enrolled in at least one local class for any attendance date. If all periods are remote or unscheduled in PowerSchool, the student receives zero attendance minutes for the day, since they are not at the assigned school on that date. 

Attendance calculations are dependent on the following: 


```
""Dependency"",""Description""
""Bell schedule (for each day based on the school calendar)."",""Bridge period time range (the maximum daily attendance minutes possible). Any scheduled time outside of the bridge period start and end times are ignored and do not apply to the total minutes.Period time lengths.Time gaps (if any) between the periods.ADA exclusion setting.Overlapping bell schedule periods are not supported within one bell schedule""
""Student schedule."",""Assigned school enrollments on a given day.Remote section enrollments.Unscheduled periods.Sections excluded from ADA. Note: Double-booked and overlapping student enrollments are not supported.""
""Deduct Passing Time attendance preference setting."",""If Deduct Passing Time preference is set to No: The only deductions that are made are for ADA-excluded periods and sections if a student is enrolled locally in that section.No deductions are made for passing time, which includes the time for unscheduled periods, remote sections, and time outside of student scheduled time that is within the bridge period time range.If Deduct Passing Time preference is set to Yes - After All Meetings: All ADA excluded periods and sections are deducted from the attendance calculation.All unscheduled periods are deducted (considered as passing time) from the attendance calculation.All remote sections are deducted (considered as passing time) from the attendance calculation.All passing time is deducted (gaps between periods) from the attendance calculation.Time outside student-scheduled time that is within the bridge period time range is deducted from the attendance calculation.If Deduct Passing Time attendance preference is set to Yes - After ADA Excluded Meetings Only: Only excluded periods and sections and any immediately following passing time is deducted (time gaps, unscheduled periods, and remote sections).All deducted time must be either an ADA excluded period or section, passing time, or unscheduled or remote periods in a contiguous unbroken manner (all follow one another in sequence in the schedule) until either an ADA included period and section, or the last period is encountered (whichever occurs first). Note: ADA exclusion is not applicable to a remote section or unscheduled period.""

"# Daily Time Exclusion Setup
To get started, configure the following setup items in the order by which they appear:"
"# Specify Attendance Preferences
To utilize Daily Time Exclusion, you must use the daily method of recording attendance. Meeting attendance may also be used in conjunction with daily attendance. Using both methods is especially helpful for those schools with block schedules in which students move between classes and each teacher must record absences and tardies. Through attendance preferences, schools can define whether lunch periods and passing time are included in or excluded from the calculated Average Daily Attendance minutes.

The following example schedule represents an elementary, closed campus school:

```
""Period"",""Time""
""Morning"",""8 to 11 a.m.""
""Lunch"",""11:10 a.m. to 12:00 p.m.""
""Afternoon"",""12:10 to 2 p.m.""
```

In this example, lunch is scheduled as a separate period, as are the morning and afternoon periods. Courses are set up to represent morning, lunch, and afternoon classes. Sections for these courses are scheduled, and students are enrolled in these sections. When the teacher takes attendance during the morning period, PowerSchool evaluates each student's schedule and calculates attendance as:

```
""Time"",""Attendance Minutes""
""8 to 11 a.m."",""180""
""12:10 to 2 p.m."",""110""
"""",""Total = 290""
```

Note that the lunch period is not included in the total attendance minutes.

Set the attendance preferences to exclude lunch periods and passing time so that PowerSchool excludes these times when attendance is recorded. The calculation determines passing time by investigating the student's schedule to find the periods in which the student is scheduled. PowerSchool then investigates the bell schedule to determine whether any passing time between the periods exists. 

1. On the start page, choose School under Setup in the main menu.
2. Under Attendance, click Preferences.
3. Select the Attendance recording methods. Any combination of the four options is valid.
4. Select Daily for the Default attendance page.
5. Select Two-way, keep records in sync for Meeting and daily attendance bridge. This option ensures that when a teacher enters attendance during the period defined as the daily attendance bridge period (defined in the bell schedule set up of periods), the attendance is reflected in both the daily attendance as well as the meeting attendance. It also ensures that when the attendance administrator updates daily attendance, the change is updated to the teacher’s attendance page. This synchronization only occurs for the period defined as the bridge period. If you are using both meeting and daily attendance methods, set separate meeting and daily attendance bridges. If you do not want to impact the teacher’s attendance page, then set this option to One-way, section to daily attendance.
6. Select Enable ADA Periods and Passing Time Deductions.
7. Choose how you want passing time deducted for Deduct Passing Time.

8. Click Submit.# Set up Attendance Conversions
If your school currently uses the daily attendance method, be sure to define the appropriate time items. For each time item, define the daily attendance value according to the number of minutes present, excluding lunch and passing time according to your school's needs. For detailed information, see Attendance Conversions."
"# Set up the Bell Schedule
Setting up the bell schedule to utilize DTE requires the following:

* Define the bridge period. 
* Identify the start and end times for school when defining the bridge period. 
    Note: Any attendance entered before the Default Time In or after the Default Time Out is not included in attendance minutes calculated and stored in PowerSchool. 

* Be sure lunch periods are excluded from ADA calculations. See Exclude from Attendance Calculation.
* If excluding passing time, be sure that the start and end times for all periods do not include passing time. See Set Passing Time. 
    Note: For more information, see Bell Schedules.# Define Bridge Period
The bridge period translates the attendance the teacher takes for that period into daily attendance minutes. When the teacher records attendance in the bridge period, daily attendance minutes are recorded. This figure is the maximum number of minutes the student can have for attendance for any given day.

1. On the start page, choose School under Setup in the main menu. 
2. Under Calendaring, click Bell Schedules. 
3. Click Edit Schedule next to the bell schedule you are working with. 
4. Click the period number for the bell schedule item you want to edit. 
5. Enter a start and end time for the period.
6. Select Counts for ADA to count this bell schedule item in average daily attendance calculations.
7. Select Use For Daily Attendance to use daily attendance for this bell schedule item.

8. Click Submit."
"# Define Lunch Period
Create and schedule lunch periods so PowerSchool knows when to exclude the total lunch period time from the attendance calculation. Time for lunch can only be excluded if the period and/or section is excluded from ADA. Create one lunch course and as many sections of lunch as are necessary to fulfill your school's lunch requirements. If students go to lunch during different periods, then create a section for each of these periods. For more information, see New Courses and Sections.# Set Passing Time
If attendance preferences are set to exclude passing time between periods, the passing time between periods is deducted. If there are no time gaps between the periods, then no time is deducted between periods. The following example shows a schedule that does not include passing time:

```
""Period"",""Time"",""Attendance Calculation""
""1 – Attendance"",""8 to 8:10 a.m."",""10 minutes""
""2 – Math"",""8:15 to 9:30 a.m."",""75 minutes""
""3 – Science"",""9:35 to 10:50 a.m."",""75 minutes""
""4 – English"",""10:55 a.m. to 12:10 p.m."",""75 minutes""
""Lunch"",""12:15 to 12:45 p.m."",""0 minutes""
""5 – Music"",""12:50 to 2:05 p.m."",""75 minutes""
""6 – PE"",""2:10 to 3:25 p.m."",""75 minutes""
"""","""",""Total = 385""
```

Note: For more information about bell schedule items, see Set Up Bell Schedule Items."
"# Exclude from Attendance Calculation
The ADA calculation inspects each section in which a student is enrolled to verify if it is marked as being excluded from the attendance calculation. If periods and sections are to be excluded from ADA (or count for ADA), the fields controlling inclusion/exclusion need to be set for each period and section. The intent of having both options is to provide some flexibility in accommodating the various types of schedules that are used. Whether the flag on the section or the period is used, students must be enrolled in a lunch section in order for the new ADA calculation to exclude the designated time.

Note: Either a bell schedule period or scheduled section can be marked for exclusion in order for the time to be excluded from the attendance calculation. In order for the meeting minutes to count in the attendance calculation, both the bell schedule period and the scheduled section need to be marked for inclusion.# Exclude a Period
1. On the start page, choose School under Setup in the main menu. 
2. Under Calendaring, click Bell Schedules.
3. Click Edit Schedule next to the name of the bell schedule you want to edit. 
4. Click the period number for the bell schedule item you want to edit. 
5. Deselect the Counts for ADA checkbox.
6. Click Submit."
"# Exclude a Section
Note: The Exclude from Attendance checkbox is also found on the Edit Course District Information page; however, the courses checkbox value is not considered when DTE calculations are made.

1. On the start page, choose School under Setup in the main menu. 
2. On the School Setup page, click Sections.
3. Choose the course name from the courses menu. 
4. Click either the period or the section number in the Per and Sec# columns. 
5. Select the Exclude from Attendance checkbox.
6. Click Submit."
"# Daily Time Exclusion Terms

```
""Term"",""Definition""

"# Work with Daily Time Exclusion

Once setup items have been configured, you can:

Schedule Students into Excluded Section
---------------------------------------

Schedule students into the defined excluded period or section. To schedule a group of students into a specific excluded section, use the Mass Enroll function. Or, schedule students on an individual basis. 

Take Attendance for Excluded Section
------------------------------------

Administrative staff must enter attendance for students who come to school after the attendance period, leave school early, or leave school for an appointment and return later during the same school day. If the student arrives to school after the attendance period, even though a teacher for another period marks the student as present or tardy (if meeting attendance method is used), the student's minutes will not be calculated and stored for ADA. The attendance administrator must enter the student's arrival through the New Daily Attendance page. Only attendance taken by the teacher during the period defined as the attendance period calculates the ADA minutes. For more information, see Daily Attendance.

Update Attendance Views
-----------------------

A special function allows you to update the attendance views as needed, rather than wait for the nightly process to execute. This same functionality automatically runs as part of the nightly process. This update process recalculates and repopulates the Membership Defaults tables based upon the date ranges you specify.

If Day Part Attendance is enabled, this process recalculates and re-populates the Day Part tables based on the date ranges you specify. For more information, see the State and Provincial Reporting Day Part Attendance Setup Guide.

1. On the start page, choose Special Functions under Functions in the main menu. 
2. Under Function, click Attendance Functions. 
3. Click Refresh Premier Attendance Views Data. 
4. Select which Students to Include in the report.
5. Specify the date range.
6. Select the Processing Options. If you selected On Specific Date/Time, enter the date to execute the report.

7. Click Submit. 




After submitting this report, it will be processed in the report queue. On the navigation bar, click Report Queue. 

Recalculate Daily Time Exclusion Attendance
-------------------------------------------

Under certain circumstances, you may need to recalculate the daily attendance minutes. These circumstances may include:

* Updating from a previous PowerSchool release.
* Changing the attendance preferences that affect DTE. 

Once this special function is generated, all daily attendance record minutes for each student are updated based on DTE attendance preferences for each school's full-year term.

1. On the start page, choose Special Functions under Functions in the main menu. 
2. Under Function, click Attendance Functions.
3. Click Recalculate Daily Attendance Minutes. 
4. Select the checkbox next to each school name for which you want to recalculate attendance minutes. For more information, refer to the field table in Update Attendance Views. 
    Note: The school context is critical in determining which schools appear on this page. When in district mode, all schools in the district that take daily attendance appear. When in school mode and the school takes daily attendance, the school appears. When in school mode and the school does not take daily attendance, the school does not appear. 

5. Click Submit. 

Daily Time Exclusion Reports
----------------------------

All ADA and ADM reports take into account the exclusion of lunch and passing time as appropriate. These reports should be run using the daily attendance mode and the time-to-day conversion option. For more information on these reports, see Membership Reports."
"# Daily Time Exclusion

Certain states require that, in specific circumstances, lunchtime and passing time between scheduled periods must be deducted from those attendance minutes that count towards the average daily attendance (ADA) to be claimed for funding from the state. PowerSchool supports the deduction of these minutes through functionality known as daily time exclusion (DTE)."
"# Attendance
Track student's attendance in several ways using the various attendance functions. Depending on your school's needs, you can track daily attendance, section attendance, or attendance by time. You can also consolidate the multiple roll calls typically required when multiple course sections meet simultaneously. There are also several attendance-related reports available. 

Given the proper permissions, administrators, teachers, and substitute teachers can take attendance using the following:

* PowerSchool SIS Admin Portal: There are several ways to take and change attendance for a student or group of students, either for one day or several days.
* PowerSchool SIS Teacher Portal: Teachers can take attendance for their current classes. 
* PowerSchool SIS Substitute Portal: Substitute teachers can take attendance for their designated classes. 
* Schoology: Teachers can take attendance for their current classes. For more information on taking attendance in Schoology, refer to Using PowerSchool SIS Attendance with Schoology."
"# Attendance Modes
There are five modes of taking attendance: by day, by meeting, by interval, by time, or concurrently.

To switch between Daily and Meeting attendance mid-year, see Attendance Synchronization. 

```
""Attendance Mode"",""Description"",""Where Used"",""Possible Actions""
""Daily Attendance"",""Take attendance for one or more days. Daily attendance calculates attendance by the minute or by attendance code."",""PowerSchool SIS Admin PortalPowerTeacher Pro"",""View and Add Daily Attendance using the Attendance GridDaily Attendance""
""Meeting Attendance"",""Take attendance by meeting. An expression, formulated by combining the periods and days in which this section takes place, represents meetings for a section.Example: """"1-2(A)"""" can represent a section of Biology that meets during first and second period on """"A"""" day."",""PowerSchool SIS Admin PortalPowerTeacher Pro"",""View and Add Meeting Attendance using the Attendance GridMeeting/Interval AttendanceRecord Meeting Attendance by Section""
""Interval Attendance"",""Interval attendance is similar to Meeting attendance in that attendance is taken at least once during any meeting. The difference is that attendance can be recorded more than once per meeting. Whether a class uses interval attendance is specified in the Section Setup for each class. The length of the period (or periods), determined by the bell schedule, and the interval duration, specified in School Attendance Preferences, determine how often you should record attendance. The system divides the length of each period by the interval duration (always rounding up) to calculate how often you should record attendance.Example: A class that takes place from 8:00 AM to 9:30 AM that has an interval duration of 60 minutes would have two opportunities to take attendance. Note: Interval attendance does not assume that a student is present or absent like meeting or daily attendance. Therefore, you must record an attendance code for each interval."",""PowerSchool SIS Admin PortalPowerTeacher Pro"",""Meeting/Interval Attendance""
""Time Attendance"",""Time attendance provides an opportunity to directly enter an attendance value for a student by entering total minutes (or hours) for a given day. Time Attendance does not relate to a specific course, but it can relate to a student's program, such as a work-study or independent study. "",""PowerSchool SIS Admin Portal"",""Time Attendance""
""Concurrent Attendance"",""Take attendance for concurrent meeting sections. Concurrently meeting sections are different sections that meet at the same time and place and have the same teacher. Teachers can choose to combine the sections' rosters and take attendance for both sections simultaneously.Example 1If a teacher teaches Spanish, SPA100, with a """"1(A)"""" meeting, and a second section of Spanish, SPA200, also with a """"1(A)"""" meeting, the teacher could use the concurrent attendance function to take attendance for both sections at the same time.Example 2If a teacher teaches English 1-3(A) (Record Once All Meetings), TA1 1(A), TA2 2(A), TA3 3(A), and Math 4(A), the teacher can take attendance for English and then click """"Record MultiMeeting Attendance for Multiple Sections,"""" which results in the combined roster of English + TA1.Example 3If a teacher teaches English 1-3(A) (Record Once All Meetings), TA1 2(A), and TA2 2(A), the teacher can navigate to the attendance page for TA2 1-2(A) and click """"Record MultiMeeting Attendance for Multiple Sections,"""" which results in the combined roster of English + TA1 + TA2.Example 4If a teacher teaches English 1-3(A) (Record Each Meeting), TA1 1(A), TA2 2(A), TA3 3(A), and Math 4(A), the teacher can take attendance for English (period 1) and then click 'Record Meeting Attendance for Multiple Sections,"""" which results in the combined roster of English (per1) + TA1.Example 5If a teacher teaches English 1-3(A) (Record Each Meeting), TA1 1(A), TA2 2(A), TA3 3(A), and Math 4(A), the teacher can take attendance for English (per2) and then click """"Record Meeting Attendance for Multiple Sections,"""" which results in the combined roster of English (per2) + TA2."",""PowerSchool SIS Teacher Portal"",""""
```"
"# Daily Attendance

In PowerSchool, your school can track both meeting and daily attendance. Students' meeting attendance records indicate their absences and tardies in each class period during the school day. Students' daily attendance records indicate their absences, tardies, and arrival and dismissal times for an entire school day.

Use the Daily Attendance function to view or change a student's attendance record. Each column represents one week, with the days of the week (MTWTF) underlined. Attendance codes are noted in the chart under each day. On the days where there is no code, the student was present.

Take or Edit Daily Attendance for an Individual Student
-------------------------------------------------------

Schools use the Daily Attendance function to select a single period to denote a student's daily attendance. By denoting the period, default times for check-in, checkout, and return-in can be defined for a daily attendance total. Attendance can be entered from the classroom using the PowerSchool SIS Teacher portal. Once the teacher enters the attendance, the office staff can then take control of a student's daily attendance. The office also can use a variety of options and reports when working with the Daily Attendance function.

With a period marked for daily attendance, the teacher automatically sets the daily attendance while taking attendance in the classroom using the PowerSchool SIS Teacher portal. Your PowerSchool administrator sets the defaults for the time in and time out. This lets teachers not only track classroom attendance, but also set the initial code for the office.

After you add a daily attendance entry, you can modify daily attendance. Click the abbreviation for the first day above each day of the week in the current term. Click the letter to display the Daily Attendance page for the date to be modified.

1. On the start page, search for and select a student. 
2. Under Academics, choose Attendance from the student pages menu.
3. Click Daily. A dash (-) indicates that school is not in session and/or the student is not enrolled on that date.
4. Select the day for which you want to enter attendance.
5. Select the attendance code.
6. Enter the time the student arrives or leaves if needed.
7. Select Exclude from Total Time Calculation to exclude this time item from the total time calculation.

8. Click Submit. 

Take or Edit Daily Attendance for Multiple Days for an Individual Student

7. Choose the attendance code to apply to the date range.
8. Select If Other Than a Default Present to either overwrite or not overwrite any existing attendance codes.

9. Click Submit. "
"# Meeting/Interval Attendance
For the days without a code in PowerSchool, your school can track meeting attendance, interval attendance, daily attendance, and time attendance. Students' meeting and interval attendance records indicate their absences and tardies in each class period during the school day. Interval attendance allows for multiple attendance records per period. Students' daily attendance records indicate their absences, tardies, and arrival and dismissal times for an entire school day. Time attendance is a simple way of adding attendance value by entering total minutes or hours for a given day.

Use the Meeting/Interval Attendance function to view or change a student's attendance record. Each column represents one week, with the days of the week MTWTF) underlined. Attendance codes are noted in the chart under each day. In the case of meeting attendance, the days without a code indicating that the student was present. With interval attendance, all days and periods must have a code.

Meeting and interval attendance functions share the same page. The primary difference between the two is that meeting allows for only one attendance record per period while interval attendance allows for multiple attendance records per period based on the specified interval. Whether the class is meeting or interval is determined by what is specified for the section in the Section Setup page. Interval attendance may not appear any different from meeting attendance if the period length is less than or equal to the specified interval duration defined in Attendance Preferences."
"# Enable Enter Attendance Link on Student Pages Menu
A shortcut to the Edit Meeting/Interval Attendance page is available via the Enter Attendance link, which appears just below the Attendance link. To enable the Enter Attendance link to appear in the student pages menu, Meeting or Interval must be selected as one of the attendance recording methods and set as the default attendance recording page on the Attendance Preferences page.# Take Meeting or Interval Attendance for a Single Day/Period
Use this procedure to take Meeting or Interval attendance for the selected student. You can mark or change a single attendance instance in a selected week. Any change recorded for meeting attendance modifies daily attendance if daily attendance is enabled and the period associated with the meeting attendance being modified is the bridge period for that day. Interval attendance never modifies daily attendance.

"# Take Attendance

There are three ways to mark or change an attendance record in PowerSchool SIS and Schoology:

* Mark or change a single attendance instance.
* Mark or change a student's attendance records for blocks of time. This is particularly useful when the student has been or will be out for an extended period.
* Mark or change a group of student's attendance records for blocks of time. This is particularly useful when a class goes on a field trip or for sporting events.

Use any or all of the methods either to change a record from the past where a code has already been entered or to enter new data for an unmarked date range, day, or period in the past or future.

Schoology Integration
---------------------

Schoology and PowerSchool SIS offer an integration that enables instructors to take attendance in Schoology using PowerSchool SIS Attendance tools. Instead of taking attendance using different sets of tools, teachers can use the same attendance tools they have access to in PowerSchool, all within Schoology courses. This means a deeper and more streamlined experience for instructors so that PowerSchool SIS and Schoology work better together. For more information on taking attendance in Schoology, see Using PowerSchool SIS Attendance with Schoology.

4. Enter the attendance code using the data entry options for the selected page. 
    Note: Blank attendance codes count as (Present). However, if using interval attendance, an attendance value may be required to be entered for each student based on the requirements for your state/province. 

5. Repeat for each different attendance code to assign.
6. Click Submit. The attendance codes are saved to the PowerSchool system."
"# Time Attendance

In PowerSchool, your school can track meeting attendance, interval attendance, daily attendance and time attendance. Students' meeting and interval attendance records indicate their absences and tardies in each class period during the school day. Interval attendance allows for multiple attendance records per period. Students' daily attendance records indicate their absences, tardies, and arrival and dismissal times for an entire school day. 
Time attendance is a simple way of adding attendance value by entering total minutes or hours for a given day. It is often used to enter work experience hours off of a timecard from a student's vocational job or for entering independent study hours. 

Use the Time Attendance function to view or change a student's time attendance record. Each column represents one week, with the days of the week (MTWTF). Attendance minutes are noted in the chart under each day.

Take Time Attendance
--------------------

After you add a time attendance entry, you can modify the entry by clicking the minutes in the appropriate day column. Multiple-time attendance entries can be made for a single day by clicking the day abbreviation. Each time the day abbreviation is clicked a new entry is displayed to be filled out. Time entries cannot be deleted but they can be given a zero minute (or hour) amount that effectively voids them.

1. On the start page, search for and select a student. 
2. Under Academics, choose Attendance from the student pages menu.
3. Click Time. A dash (-) indicates that school is not in session and/or the student is not enrolled on that date.
4. Click the day abbreviation in a week where you want to enter or change attendance. 
5. Choose the attendance code.
6. Enter the total amount of attendance time for this record.
7. Let the system know whether the time value entered is in minutes or hours. The system will convert the value to minutes when it is stored. Hours are not stored with the record.
8. Specify whether these hours are associated with a program in which the student is enrolled.
9. Enter comments as needed.

10. Click Submit. "
"# Batch School Setup

On this page:

Introduction
------------

Use Batch School Setup to set up the school years and terms, calendar, reporting terms, and quick lookup settings at the beginning of the year. The Batch School Setup page displays a list of schools within the district and indicators of the settings for each school. Batch School Setup supports localization, customizations, and database extensions. If you have enabled state/provincial compliance, that extension data will be included in the batch setup process.

Before Getting Started
----------------------

Before getting started, note the following:

* Pushing calendar settings may be done as many times as your district needs.
* If pushing a district calendar, set up the cycle days and bell schedules, and then copy the calendar to each school you will be working with.
* Only schools that you have access to that are not the Graduated School, not inactive, not the source school, where no Terms record exists for the same YearID appear in the Years and Terms target school list.
* Only schools that you have access to that are not the Graduated School, not inactive, where no Calendar\_Day record exists for the same YearID appear in the Calendar target school list.
* Only schools that you have access to that are not the Graduated School, not inactive, not the source school, where no TermBins record exists for the same YearID appear in the Reporting Terms target school list.
* Only schools that you have access to that are not the Graduated School, not inactive, not the source school, where the YearID is the same appear in the Quick Lookup target list.

* If the source school's reporting terms are not an exact match for the target school's reporting terms, only matching reporting terms are pushed. Schools, where reporting terms were not pushed, are identified within the confirmation message as partially successful.

* A green checkmark for Years and Terms, Calendars, and Reporting Terms that have been successfully set up.

* Years and Terms setup is defined as at least a year Terms record matching the Term Context Year. The sub-terms (semesters, quarters, etc) do not need to exist. 

* Calendar setup is defined as at least one Calendar\_Day record with a cycle day or a bell schedule defined for the Term Context Year.

* Reporting Terms setup is defined as at least one reporting term (TermBins) in the year (Term) for the Term Context Year.

* Quick Lookup appears blank (no TermBinAttrib record) even when successfully set up. If Quick Lookup is updated (at least one TermBinAttrib record), the date the update occurred appears.

"# Change History
On this page:"
"# Introduction
Change History provides administrators with the ability to enable, monitor, and track certain PowerSchool SIS data that has been added, changed, or deleted. Each historical record includes the name of the user that made the change (or System if made by PowerSchool), the date and time the change was made, and exactly what was changed. Historical records can be viewed individually or en masse.# Data Retention
When you enable Change History on your system, any recorded change is retained for 365 days from the date on which the change was recorded. As part of the End-of-Year Process, Change History records older than 365 days will be purged from your PowerSchool database. This retention policy is subject to change and will be reviewed annually. Districts have the opportunity to retain Change History records for up to 10 years. This setting is configured within the PowerSchool SIS installer on your server. To view your current Retain Change History setting, go to Start Page > System > System Settings > Change History Settings. Please note that Change History records will require additional storage. Hosted customers that would like more than one year of data retention should contact their Account Executive for a quote to upgrade to 10 years of data retention."
"# Data Management Recommendations
* Change History should be disabled during new implementations and data migrations. 
* A yearly backup should be taken before running the End-of-Year Process.
* Utilize the Download function to perform data analysis outside of the PowerSchool SIS.# Before Getting Started
Before getting started, note the following:

* It is recommended to secure the Change History Settings page using user access and page permissions.
* When additional categories are added, the categories will inherit the default user access settings.

* Information appears based on your user access, field-level access, and whether the page is accessed at the district level or school level. 

* Fields included in the Contacts category do not belong to a single database table. As a result, contacts change history records may not appear in order or be grouped as expected.

* When viewing a staff record that has been deleted, the Staff column is blank. When viewing a student record that has been deleted, the Student and School columns are blank. The changes are still tracked and, if needed, the data can be determined by examining the data in the database tables.
* The PDF format is restricted to a maximum of 1000 records.
* Using the CSV format to download data that contains right-to-left Unicode characters may result in the incorrect ordering of data. In which case, you can reconfigure your system, use a client, such as Google Sheets, or download the data in XLSX format.
* When using the CSV format to download data that contain multi-line text, newline characters are automatically replaced with ""\\n"" or ""<br/>"" depending on if the field is plain text or HTML.
* If you have localized your version of PowerSchool, you must have the required character set installed to export in your specified language."

"# Contacts

PowerSchool provides districts with the ability to associate multiple contacts to students for both emergency and non-emergency situations. Contacts are their own entity in PowerSchool, with their own data that can be shared with multiple students to support interconnected relationships and modern family structures."
"# Direct Database Access

It is strongly recommended that you do not delete a student from the Student table. When a student record is deleted from the Student table, the link to the Person table is broken, promoting the student to a contact, while retaining the contact and any of the contact data, and making the student, now as a contact, visible in Contact Search."
"# Duplicate Contacts
Duplicate contacts can be consolidated into a single contact record. Be warned that this function is irreversible. It should only be performed by users that understand how custom data is managed in your specific PowerSchool system. Data that can be merged is moved from the duplicate contacts onto a chosen master contact record. The master is the only record preserved after consolidation. The secondary contacts, and any additional web access accounts, are deleted from PowerSchool. A preview screen is presented before final consolidation, but be sure any additional or custom data tied to these contacts has been consolidated outside of these pages prior to running this operation."
"# About the Consolidate All Option
* All data that can be merged will be added to the master record, however whenever there will be data conflicts, the data on the master record ""wins"". The consolidated contact will always retain the master Access Account, Relationship Type, and Original Contact Type value (if present). To prevent data loss you are encouraged to review each individual contact record and update the master records as necessary before final consolidation. PowerSchool will attempt to retain custom data related to any PowerSchool records that are associated with the master or merged into the master. However, not all custom data will be preserved when duplicate items are encountered across the contacts selected for consolidation.
* The access account of the master record is always preserved, when present. If the master record does not have an access account then the system will use the access account from another contact in the list, as long as there is only one to choose from. If there is more than one access account to choose from then the system will not be able to resolve which access account should be used. This situation can be avoided by selecting the master contact with the desired access account. You can also first consolidate the master record with the contact that has the desired access account in a separate transaction, after which you can consolidate the master with any other number of contacts.
* For any given student, the Original Contact Type value is retained on the master record, when present. Otherwise the value from one of the other contacts in the list is used. If there is more than one value for the same student then the system will leave it blank. In this case the correct value can be selected in the preview page before final consolidation.
* If you want to discard all data except for what is already part of the chosen master record, then use the consolidation option Keep Master Only."
"# Consolidate Duplicate Contacts
1. On the start page, do one of the following:
    * Click the Contacts tab.
    * Choose Contact Search under People in the main menu.
2. Search for contacts you want to edit. 
3. Click Select By Hand. 
4. Do one of the following:
    * Select the checkbox in the header row to select all contacts.
    * Select the checkbox next to each contact you want to consolidate.
5. Click Select Function.
6. Click Consolidate Contacts. 
7. Note the Master column and verify the correct contact is selected as the master record for the consolidation. If the correct contact is not selected, select the option next to the contact that you want to become the master record for the consolidation. The master record is the only record that will remain after consolidation. 
    Note: If a contact is selected as the master, it may not be excluded from the merge. 

8. Note the Exclude column. Select the checkbox next to any contact that you want to exclude from the merge. 
    Note: If a contact is excluded from the merge, it may not be selected as the master. 

9. Do one of the following:
    * Select the Consolidate All Data to consolidate all contact information into the master record. All core data that can be consolidated from the secondary contacts will be merged.
    * Select the Keep Master Only to discard all contact information expect the master record.
10. Click Review. 
11. Verify the information for the consolidated contact is correct. If not, edit the information as needed. At this stage, you may safely use the browser Back button to return to any prior step of the process. 
    Note: If a warning message appears indicating that the contact has Data Access to one or more students but does not have a Web Access Account, you will need to resolve before being able to proceed. Note the Submit Consolidation button is disabled. To resolve, add a Web Access Account by clicking Add Account just below the warning message and then entering all of the required information, remove all student Data Access scrolling to the Student section and clicking Edit > Data Access > Deselect Can Access Student Data And Email > Ok for each student, or return to the Consolidate Contacts page and select a different master record that has a Web Access Account. 
    Note: If a warning message appears indicating student detail conflicts have been encountered, you will need to resolve before being able to proceed. Overlapping dates are not permitted between relationship detail records, including when two records have no dates. To resolve, edit or remove the relationship detail records or adjust their dates. To edit a relationship detail record, click the Edit (pencil) icon of the student, click the All tab, edit Start Date and End Date as needed, and then click OK. To remove a relationship detail record, click the Delete (minus) icon of the student and then click Delete again. 

12. Click Submit Consolidation. 
13. Do one of the following:

    * Click Ok to proceed. 
        Important Note: This action is not reversible. 


    * Click Cancel if you do not want to proceed."
"# Export Contacts

Using the Data Export Manager, you can export contact information from PowerSchool by choosing PowerSchool Data Sets from the Category pop-up menu, and then Contacts from the Export From pop-up menu. Additionally, you can export legacy contact information from PowerSchool by choosing PowerSchool Data Sets from the Category pop-up menu, and then Student Legacy Contacts from the Export From pop-up menu.

About Exporting Contacts
------------------------

The Contacts module provides the ability to export a contact along with associated addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, and students. When exporting contacts:

* At least one row will be rendered for every contact in the export.
* Multiple rows will be rendered if a contact has multiple instances of any mapped column value. For example, if the email address column is selected for export and the contact has two email address records then two rows will be rendered.
* The number of rows rendered for a contact will be equal to the greatest number of repeated column values that were selected for export. A simple example is if a contact has 2 emails, 3 phones, 1 address and 4 students (each with a single detail record) then 4 rows will be rendered. In that same example, if each student had 2 detail records then 8 rows would be rendered.
* If multiple rows are rendered, the contact ID, DCID and name fields will be rendered on each row (when selected for export). The remaining ""Person"" columns will only be rendered on the first row.
* Extended table and child table columns can be selected for export. It is recommended, but not necessary, to include related core table fields in order to do so.
* Extended table values will be rendered on a single row. That row will be the first row on which any related core table fields appear.
* Child table values will appear on a separate row for each child record.
* When multiple child records are rendered for a single parent record, all the parent record's mapped fields are repeated on each row along with the child data. This is true for both student contact details (child of student contact) and any child table extensions.

When exporting contacts, you can use the Built In Filters to narrow the list of results:

```
""Field"",""Description""
""Students to Include"",""Select the checkbox to limit the export to contacts that are associated with the selected students.Note: Students to include dependent upon whether you are signed in at the school or district level.""

```"
"# Import Contacts
Using the Data Import Manager, you can import new contacts, as well as update existing contact information into PowerSchool by clicking Choose File to select a file to import, and then choosing Contacts from the Import Into pop-up menu."
"# About Importing Contacts
The Contacts module provides the ability to import a contact along with associated addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, and students. Additionally, the Contacts module provides the ability to import information into Person, Address, Email, Phone Number, and Students extension tables. In order to associate more than one of any child record, multiple related rows are included in the import file. Some fields have rules regarding what is a valid value (dates, booleans, code sets). An invalid value may cause a single row or multi-row import to fail. Multi-row imports have additional checks for duplicates and conflicting values. Below are rules for duplicates and conflicts for each entity. Duplicates are ignored during the import, while conflicts are rejected with appropriate error messages. When processing multiple related rows, the import process rejects all related rows if any of the rows have an error. The Import Results page displays applicable error messages for each failed row.# Access Accounts
By default, parents can create their own access accounts in the PowerSchool Student and Parent portal. However, you have the option to create access accounts on behalf of the parents by disabling self-registration and then using the Data Import Manager to create access accounts and activate when importing new contacts. Additionally, you can update access accounts and activate/deactivate or delete the access account altogether when importing existing contacts. When importing contacts:

* If the contact already exists, the contact ID is required, as it is for updating other aspects of a contact.
* If the contact does not exist, the contact identifier and contact last name is required.
* Access Account must be associated with at least one student upon creation or one student association with contact must already exist.
* Prior to linking a student to a parent access account, be sure that Enable Parent Access is enabled.
* Allow Data Access should be enabled for each student the contact needs access to. If it is not set, the value will default to false."

"# Parent Web Account Access

By default, parents can create their own access accounts in the PowerSchool Student and Parent portal. When a parent creates an account through self-registration, a matching mechanism automatically associates the account with existing contacts based on first name, last name, and email. Names and emails must be exact and return only one match result. Once the account is created, an email verification is sent to the parent containing a link that the parent must use to to sign in to their PowerSchool account within 24 hours of receiving the message. Once the parent signs in using the link, the parent can start using their account. If the parent does not sign in using the link and it expires, the parent can request a new link be emailed to them.

You have the option to create access accounts on behalf of the parents by disabling self-registration and then using the Data Import Manager to create access accounts. Once the access accounts are created, you will need to provide parents with their account information using the 'acctemail' (recovery email) and 'acctid' (username) values available in the Contact Information DAT. Once parents receive this information, they will need to reset their passwords the first time they sign into their new account using the Reset Password link. 

Once parent access accounts are created, whether by the parent or by your district, you can use the Contact Search to find and consolidate accounts more easily, as the search now returns results for both contact emails and parent access account emails. "

"# Course Prerequisites

The introduction of Course Prerequisites provides the ability to define and enforce prerequisite rules that automatically limit the courses a student may request. With a multitude of options — such as percent grade, letter grade, credit hours, concurrent request, and teacher recommendation — you can build as comprehensive a rule as necessary for each course in order to help students request only those courses for which they are academically prepared to be successful."
"# Invalid Requests

"# At Risk Data Grid

The At Risk Data Grid is a data visualization tool that you can set up, enable, and use to quickly and easily view at risk student information for your school or district.

How the Calculation Works
-------------------------

The calculation uses the student's grade by section (for a school) whose start and end dates include the current date. The calculation always chooses the grade for the section with the longest interval (end date - start date); that (usually) corresponds to a term start and end date. The grade scale item color is then used to compute the percentage which determines the percent risk. The percent risk is then mapped to the risk index as a color coded value. In some ways, the percent risk mapping is similar to the attendance conversions that use thresholds to map to attendance values."

"# District Race Codes

On this page:

In order for a federal race category to appear on the student General Demographics page and the staff Edit Information page, at least one district race code must be defined for that federal race category. For example, if the federal race category of (A) Asian is defined, the district race code of (A) Asian must also be defined. If multiple district race codes are defined within a single federal race category, they will appear grouped together on the student General Demographics page and the staff Edit Information page. If no district race codes are defined within a particular federal race category, that category will not appear on the student General Demographics page and the staff Edit Information page.

District race codes may be imported when importing federal race categories or they can be manually entered. Once district race codes are defined, indicate the sort order in which you want each district race code to display relative to other district race codes for a given federal ethnicity category.

For state-specific information, see PowerSchool recommended state-specific setup of federal race and ethnicity settings available on your state-specific help site.

Import District Race Codes
--------------------------

During the initial setup of federal ethnicity and race, use the Quick Import function to transfer district race codes into the PowerSchool Race Codes table. The import file must include the following columns: Name (RaceCode), Value (FederalCode), ValueT (Description), Value2 (AltRaceCode), and SortOrder. For general information, see Quick Import. For state-specific information, see PowerSchool recommended state-specific setup of federal race and ethnicity settings available on your state-specific help site.

Using the Fee Exemption Status pop-up menu, you can indicate whether or not a student is subject to school or course enrollment fees. While you can indicate that school or course fees not be automatically assessed, this does not prohibit fees from being manually assessed.

Note: Field level security may be used to restrict this information (STUDENTS.FEE\_EXEMPTION\_STATUS).

"# Fee Functions
On this page:

Fee Functions offers similar functionality as Fee Transactions, but these functions are used for a selected group of students. You can access Fee Functions one of two ways: click Special Functions on the start page or search for and select a group of students and then choose Fee Functions from Group Functions. From the Fee Functions page, you can create transactions, assess school enrollment and course enrollment fees, and clear current balances. Each time you perform a group fee function, the system generates a group ID. The group ID can then be used to perform additional actions, such as reversing fee assessments or transactions and generating reports.}"
"# Group Transaction IDs Warning
Each time such a group transaction is performed, a new Group Transaction ID is generated and assigned to each record created by the transaction. When running any of the group functions that require entering a Group Transaction ID, be sure to enter the correct Group Transaction ID. If you inadvertently enter the wrong Group Transaction ID, you may be affecting a large amount of data, and reversing the error may take considerable time. To find the group transaction ID, check at least one fee or transaction record that has been created by the group fee functions.# Add Student Fees for Group of Students
Using the Fee Functions page, you can manually assess a group of students with student fees, such as Recreational Field Trip. Be sure the information you enter is accurate, as there is no edit or delete function for student fees (to preserve the history of the transaction). If you inadvertently make a mistake, you will have to create a transaction using payment, credit, or void to reverse the effect.

To manually assess an individual student with student fees, see Fee Transactions.

"# Auto-Complete Data Sets

On this page: 

Overview
--------

The Single Line Text element has the ability to utilize auto-complete data sets. When a responder starts typing into a Single Line Text element with an auto-complete data set defined, items within the set are presented and filtered by what the user has already been entered. The user can then choose an item from the list to set as their response to the element.

Auto-complete data sets allow you to define a set of data once rather than defining the set with each use, such as when using a Dropdown or Multiple Choice element. Especially when the number of options is large, auto-complete data sets provide a performance benefit compared to a Dropdown or Multiple Choice element with the same set of choices.

When setting an auto-complete data set on a Single Line Text element, you have the option to Restrict Response to List, which requires that the value in the Single Line Text element is a value found in the data set. If this option is not selected, the auto-complete data set acts as a list of suggestions but any value can be entered by the user.

Define Data Sets
----------------

### Pre-Built Data Sets

The auto-complete option currently offers the following pre-coded data sets.

```
""Data Set"",""Description""
""Country List"",""List of country names""
""Previous Responses"",""The data set is comprised of all values that previous users have submitted in this field. Not recommended to use this set with the Restrict Response to List option.""
""Students (Class)"",""List of students in class the form is shared with (teacher created form only). ""
""Students (School)"",""List of students in the current school.""
""Students (District)"",""List of all students in the district.""
""Schools (District)"",""List of all schools in the district.""
""Student Current Schedule"",""For a student form, a list of the student’s enrolled classes for the current year.""
""Teachers (School)"",""List of teachers in the current school.""
""Teachers (District)"",""List of all teachers in the district.""
```

### Custom Data Sets

You can also create your own auto-complete data sets.

#### Gen Table Category

One method is to create a Gen table category. The easiest way to accomplish this is by creating a tab-delimited text file with one column for the category, another column for the label (visible text), and a third for the value that is saved when the form is submitted. Because this is a Single Line Text box, the label and value must be the same. You also have the option to store a value in the database that is different than the displayed value. To use this option, add a fourth column for ValueT. The data may look similar to this:

Under Special Functions, choose Importing & Exporting, then choose Quick Import, and select table Gen Table (code values). Map the first column to Cat, the second to Name, the third to Value, and the optional fourth to ValueT.



You can now reference bus\_route in the box labeled Category in your Single Line Text element’s properties.

End-User Experience
-------------------

When the end-user views a form with a Single Line Text element that has been linked to an auto-complete data set, a list button is displayed at the end of the element. 

When the user clicks the button, a list of all the items in the data set appears.

The user can select an item directly from the list to populate the Single Line Text element.

Alternatively, the user can type into the Single Line Text element, and options appear from the data set that match what the user is typing. The user can then choose a filtered option to populate the Single Line Text element."

Pre-Registration Submissions Report

Refer to the Pre-Registration Submissions Report for details."

"# Pre-Registration Submissions Report
Before students can be created in the Student Information System, they must first be approved by an administrator. Use the Pre-registration Submissions Report to manage and approve submissions for new student enrollment.

1. From the Start Page, choose Form Reports.
2. Click the Other Reports tab.
3. Choose Pre-registration Submissions.
4. Choose a form.
5. Filter the responses.
    1. Filter by Schools and Terms.
        * This filter is part of the Admin portal in PowerSchool SIS.
        * Filtering at District Office will allow you to view submissions to all schools.
        * Filtering by an individual school will restrict responses to pending approval and approved responses for the school that you are looking at.
        * The school year filter restricts responses based on the Entry Year submitted; only responses will appear where the entry year matches the school year.
        * The school year at an individual school needs to match the school year configured at the district office.
    2. Use other filters.
        * Status
            * Pending — You can only approve and edit records when viewing pending submissions.
            * ALL — Includes Approved, Rejected, and Pending. Only available at the district level.
            * Approved — Only available at the school level.
            * Filtering by rejected is not yet available. 
        * First Name
        * Last Name
        * Grade Level
6. Click the Columns button to add form fields to the report. 

7. To edit pre-registration submissions, click Edit to update one or multiple submissions at once. 

    * Editing is only available for submissions in the pending state. 
    * The School Preference element can only be updated at the district level.

    * When editing multiple submissions at once: 
        * First Name, Last Name, Date of Birth, Gender, and School Preference do not support multiple edits.
        * All fields left blank will retain their existing values.
8. To export submission records, click the Export option arrow.
    * You can export in CSV and XLS format.
    * Regardless of record selection, all the responses will be exported.
    * All form fields that you added as columns will be included in the export.
    * When exporting ALL submissions from the district office, you will see three additional columns: Approved, Rejected, and Pending. This will show the schools that the student was approved, rejected, or pending in the right status. 
9. To delete a submission, select the submission record and click Delete.
10. To reject a pre-registration submission, select the record and click Reject. 
    * Rejecting a pre-registration submission will move the submission to their next school preference choice and will appear within Pending status of that location.
    * If school preference is not enabled, or if the student has been rejected from all their schools, the student will not appear in Pending status for any school. 
    * The parent will receive a rejection email.
11. To approve pre-registration submissions and initiate a duplicate student check, select the students you wish to approve and click Approve. 

    1. Student Matching is built into the approval workflow. 

    1. If you are approving more than one student, first check for duplicates within your approval batch to verify whether a parent mistakenly submitted a pre-registration form twice for the same student. 
        * If the system finds a potential duplicate, you are responsible for determining whether they are actual duplicate submissions. 
        * The system compares certain attributes and displays them if they differ between the submissions. 
        * If you Continue, multiple students will be created.
        * If you Cancel, you will need to manually delete or reject the duplicates.
    2. Before approval, the system runs a duplicate student search across your SIS database to find potential matches.
        * If at least one potential match is found, you will be required to resolve those matches. 
        * The duplicate student search has an updated algorithm. This algorithm was originally released for the PowerSchool Enrollment product on the 20.11 release, and we are now using it for Enrollment Express. 
        * When resolving potential matches you are presented a comparison view between the newly submitted student and their potential duplicate in the SIS.
            * Review the attributes with different values and determine whether one of the potential matches is a duplicate. 
            * If you determine the submission is not a duplicate, click Skip without marking the checkbox.
    3. After you resolve the duplicates, you will see a confirmation modal with three sections:
        * Create — This will include all students that are not duplicates of an existing student, whether you manually skipped them, or no duplicates were found for them at all. 
        * Merge — These are duplicates of inactive students or transferred-out students. These students are expected to complete their pre-registration form for the school that they applied for. Merging will move the students to the school that was configured, whether it was the enrollment school or their approved school. 
        * Do not Approve — These are duplicates of Active students. This likely means that parents completed the wrong form since they are active in the district. They should not be completing new student registration and their status should not be pre-registered, so we will not approve these records. When you click Approve, they will be omitted from approval. You will have to communicate this to the parent and delete the submission. 
    4. If you are prevented from creating a new student, there is an issue with the data.
        1. Review the error message to resolve the issue.
    5. Click Approve.
        * The parent is sent an approval email if this is enabled. 
        * The student is created or moved to their appropriate school. 
            * The student is automatically created in PowerSchool through an API. 
        * If Use Enrollment School is enabled in the form properties:
            * The student is created or moved to the enrollment school. 
            * Their approved school and school number are added to the Exit Comment. The exit comment can then be used to determine which school the student will need to be transferred into after they complete their new student enrollment packet. 
        * If Enroll in Approved School is enabled in the form properties:
            * The student is created or moved to the school that they were approved for. 
        * The student's enrollment status is determined by the Years and Terms configuration in the district setup.

            * When a parent submits a pre-registration form with an entry date within the current term:

                * When the submission is approved and a new student is created, the student is enrolled with an Active enrollment status.

                * When the submission is approved and the student is merged with an inactive or transferred-out student record, the student’s enrollment status is changed to Active.

            * When a parent submits a pre-registration form with an entry date for a future term:
                * When the submission is approved and a new student is created, the student is enrolled with a Pre-registered enrollment status.
                * When the submission is approved and the student is merged with an inactive or transferred-out student record, the student’s enrollment status is changed to Pre-registered.
12. To resend the initial Pre-registration email with access credentials on an approved record, select the record and click Resend Email."

"# Manage Approvals
On this page: 

When a form has an approval process enabled, changes are not written to the PowerSchool database until the form is approved unless it was submitted through the Admin portal. The approval process includes approval activation, form submission, and form approval."
"# Activate Approvals
1. Select Forms from the Start Page menu and open your form in the Form Editor.
2. Select the form Title.
3. Select the Approval option in the form properties.
4. Enter an Approval Password.
    1. Share this password with designated approvers.
5. Click the chain link icon to display the Approval Options window.
6. Select the number of individual approvers.
    * By default, approval only requires one administrator to approve a form.
    * You can set the process to require up to five individual approvers.
7. Click Apply.
8. Select Edit Pending Responses to allow approvers to edit a response before proceeding with approval.
    * The form continues to appear as submitted by the responder (parent).
    * Edits are made to the existing response record rather than creating a new one.
    * Approvers can edit responses for all fields except the Event Calendar. Static and read-only field elements cannot be edited.
    * Admins see the latest changes on the pending response made by other admins. 

9. PowerSchool recommends using the Notification feature in conjunction with approval.
    1. Select Notification.
    2. Enter the approvers’ Email addresses, separated by commas. Each time someone submits the form, these approvers will receive an email notification. 
10. Click Save Form.# Submit the Form
The Approval feature only works on the Parent, Student, and Teacher portals. Forms with Approval active are automatically approved if submitted through the Admin portal.

When users submit a form on the Parent portal, the form turns yellow and an information message alerts them the form is pending approval. Any form elements linked to PowerSchool fields and updated in the most recent responses will have a red flag appear above them. Hover the pointer over a flag to display the old and new field values."
"# Approve the Form
# Locate Pending Approvals
Approvers can locate forms that are pending approval in several ways:

* If notifications are set up in the form properties, the approver receives an email when the responder submits a form. The email contains the form name and student or teacher ID, if appropriate.
* The approver is alerted in the Admin portal’s Notifications icon. When selected, forms awaiting approval are displayed with a count of students or teachers. Select the number link to view the selection of students or teachers, then choose a student or teacher record to locate the form. The row in the form list will be highlighted yellow with a yellow leaf next to it.
* The approver can run the Response Report for the form to view forms awaiting approval. Filter the Approval Status to view Pending responses. Select the Student Number to view the form."
"# Review Responses
When the form is opened, it displays the most recent responses. The approver can choose a different response by clicking the gear icon in the upper right portion of the form. A dialog displays the previous responses; those highlighted yellow are awaiting approval. Select a response and click Load Response. Approvers should be most concerned with fields marked with a red flag. These are the elements the responder has changed that are linked to PowerSchool fields. Hover the pointer over the flag to display the old value compared to the new value.

If Edit Pending Responses is enabled in the form properties, the approver can edit pending responses, if needed.# Reject or Approve the Form
To reject or approve responses from the form itself:

1. Click Reject or Approve.
2. If you are rejecting the response:
    1. Enter the Approval Password.
    2. Add a Reason/Note, if needed.
    3. Click Reject.
3. If you are approving a response:
    1. Enter the Approval Password.
    2. Click Approve.

To reject or approve multiple responses at once, use the response report:

1. On the Start Page, choose Form Reports in the Reports section.
2. Locate and select the report.
3. Filter the approval type by Pending approval.
4. Click Generate Report.
5. Use the checkboxes to select multiple responses.
6. From the Actions menu, choose Approve Selected or Reject Selected.
7. If you are rejecting the responses:
    1. Enter the Approval Password.
    2. Add a Reason/Note, if needed.
    3. Click Reject.
8. If you are approving the responses:
    1. Enter the Approval Password.
    2. Click Approve.

If the parent submitting the form has their Parent Preferences set up to notify them when the status of the form has changed, they will receive an email indicating the form was approved or rejected.

After the approver accepts the form, a green leaf appears on the form record on the responder's Forms page.

If a form is rejected, a red leaf appears on the form record and the entire row is highlighted red. If the approver provided a reason for rejecting the form, a message appears when the responder opens the form. When the responder clicks Edit Rejected, the form opens as it was rejected, and the responder can make changes and resubmit the form."
"# Map Workflows

Use workflow mapping to create intelligent forms that show the user fields and information based on their previous selections. For example, PowerSchool has three sets of contact fields available per student. You can either display all fieldsets on the form or ask the user how many they want to fill out (1, 2, or 3) and display only that number of fieldsets. As a result, a complex form becomes shorter and easier to read.

Workflow mapping also allows you to display different elements given specific selections. For example, your form might ask the parent how they will transport their child to school. If they answer Parent pickup/drop-off, that can trigger a field to appear for Alternative Driver to designate who can pick the child up when the parents are unavailable. Alternatively, if they select School Bus, you can present a drop-down list from where they can choose the nearest bus stop.

To add a workflow to a form element:

1. From the Start Page, select Forms in the Applications section.
2. On the My Forms tab, click the Edit Form icon on the form record to launch the Form Editor.
3. Choose the element that will become visible based on another element’s value.
4. In the Properties window, select the Workflow Mapping checkbox in the Options section.
5. Click the Select Workflow Element icon.
    * Most of the screen will be grayed out, except for elements that are eligible to be a determinant element.
    * If the element you want is not available, try saving the form first and try again.
6. Select the dependent element.
    * Once you link the determinant element, it should be highlighted in orange when the initial element is selected.
7. Enter the Value for Visibility.
    * This is the value of the determinant element that will trigger this element to appear.
    * The value can be set to multiple possible values using the pipe character (|). For example, you can trigger the appearance of the dependent element for grades 1 through 4 with the value 1|2|3|4.
    * If the determinant element has choices with separate text and hidden values, the Value for Visibility must be set to the hidden value, not the visible text.
    * If the dependent element is a single-line text element, you can trigger the workflow with a specific Value for Visibility.
    * If you wish that any entry activates it, enter \[^\]+
8. If needed, add more dependent elements and set the Value for Visibility.
9. Click Save Form."

"# Document Attachments

On this page: 



Cloud Document Attachments
--------------------------

Some forms allow users to submit documents with the form. The person filling out the form logs into the secure document management service to submit a document. Only the person who submitted the attachment and specified people at the school have access to the documents.

Users can attach documents up to 5MB each. Accepted file formats are .PDF, .RTF, .DOC, .DOCX, .PNG, .JPG, and .JPEG. The upload service disallows all other file types. Documents uploaded through Cloud Document Attachment will not attach to Student Attachments in SIS; they are stored in a secure, external server outside the SIS.

To review attachments uploaded in forms, navigate to the student and select the form or select the form response via the Response report. 

Users are required to log in to the element to upload. This login is different than their PowerSchool SIS login, and for parents, it will be different from their Parent Portal login. 

Administrators can enable Single Sign-On. For districts on Ecollect ECO\_20.1.0.0 or later, SSO can be enabled for the Parent and Student portals. When enabled, users of these portals do not need a separate Document Attachment login; they are automatically logged in using their PowerSchool Portal credentials.

"# About Searching
On this page:"
"# Search Basics
Learning how to perform searches is the key to using PowerSchool since you select a student or group of students with whom you are going to work. Before you can do any type of work on a student's record or a group's records, select the individual or group. By performing a search, you make such a selection. The simplest search finds just one student, but it is possible to perform more complex searches.

When performing both simple and advanced searches, it is important to keep in the mind the following:

* Any work with student records always begins with a search. You must tell PowerSchool which records to retrieve to work with an individual student record or a group of students.
* Enter field names in the Search field exactly as they are written in the field list. PowerSchool cannot find a field when its spelling does not match the fields in PowerSchool. The placement of underscores (\_) is just as important. To verify the correct spelling of a field, click View Field List on the PowerSchool start page.
* While the spelling of the field name is important, the case is not. Enter gender=f, Gender=F, GENDer=F, or any variation thereof. PowerSchool searches are not case-sensitive.
* Separate different search criteria in the command line with a semicolon (;).

PowerSchool provides powerful tools to search the database of students at your school. On the start page, use the box labeled ""Search Students"" to find students by surname. For example, enter MA to find all students whose last names begin with MA.# Search Command Line
A search command is a line of text that you can use to command PowerSchool to perform a search. The search command is comprised of three parts: a field name, a comparator, and a search argument or value. The command line should appear in this format: \[field name\]\[comparator\]\[search argument\]. For example, to find all of the students in your school whose first name is Kate, you would enter First\_Name=kate in the Search field."
"# Field Names and Values
PowerSchool stores student information in fields and those fields contain values. Fields are tools that you can use to search and retrieve records. To view a complete list of available field names, click View Field List on the start page."
"# Comparators
Comparators are tools that you use to search and retrieve records by combining two or more criteria. A combination of comparators and fields are used in searches to narrow the results to a very small group of students at your school. The following are some of the most common comparators:

```
""Comparator"",""Meaning"",""Description""
""="",""Equals"",""Use this comparator to search for records that are the value of the field. Suppose you want to find all students in your school with the last name of Jones. Find them with the following search command:last_name=JonesThis instructs PowerSchool to go through each student record and return those records that have Jones in the last_name field.""
""< "",""is less than"",""Use this comparator to search for records that are less than the value of the field. Suppose you want to find all students in your school who are in a grade level less than 12th grade. Find them with the following search command:grade_level<12This instructs PowerSchool to go through each student record and return those records that have any value less than 12 in the grade_level field.""
""> "",""is greater than"",""Use this comparator to search for records that are greater than the value of the field. Suppose you want to find all students in your school who are in a grade level greater than 9th grade. Find them with the following search command:grade_level>9This instructs PowerSchool to go through each student record and return those records that have any value greater than 9 in the grade_level field""
""<="",""is less than or equal to"",""Use this comparator to search for records that are less than or equal to the value of the field. Suppose you want to find all students in your school who are in a grade level less than or equal to 12th grade. Find them with the following search command:grade_level<=12This instructs PowerSchool to go through each student record and return those records that have any value less than or equal to 12 in the grade_level field.""
"">="",""is greater than or equal to"",""Use this comparator to search for records that are greater than or equal to the value of the field. Suppose you want to find all students in your school who are in a grade level greater than or equal to 10th grade. Find them with the following search command:grade_level>=10This instructs PowerSchool to go through each student record and return those records that have any value greater than or equal to 10 in the grade_level field.""
""#"",""does not equal"",""Use this comparator to search for records that are not the value of the field. Suppose you want to find all students in your school who are not in 12th grade. Find them with the following search command:grade_level#12This instructs PowerSchool to go through each student record and return those records that do not have 12 in the grade_level field.""
""in"",""is [field] present in the search argument?"",""Use this comparator to verify that the value of the field matches any argument in the list you provide. For example, if you want a list of all the ninth, tenth, and eleventh graders at your school, enter the following search command line:grade_level in 9,10,11In this example, the field is grade_level, the comparator is """"in,"""" and the search argument is 9,10,11. Note that the items in the argument are separated with commas. This tells PowerSchool to find all students in grade levels 9, 10, and 11. PowerSchool goes to the grade_level field in each student record and returns the records where the entry is 9, 10, or 11.FROM ABOVEThe comparator """"in"""" is a powerful tool that allows you to verify if the value of the field matches any search argument in a list you provide. For example, to obtain a single list of all 9th, 10th, and 11th graders in your school, enter the following search command line:grade_level in 9,10,11PowerSchool displays all students whose grade level is contained in the list 9, 10, and 11. In this example, the field is """"grade_level"""", the comparator is """"in"""", and the search argument is """"9,10,11"""". The search function looks at the specified field for every student and checks to see if that field matches anything in the search argument specified. When entering a search command line, separate a list of items in a search argument with commas.""
""contains"",""is the search argument contained in the [field]?"",""Use this comparator to search for records that have the value of the field. Suppose you want to find all students in your school who live on Cherry Lane. Find them with the following search command:mailing_street contains Cherry LaneThis instructs PowerSchool to go through each student record and return the records that have Cherry Lane in the mailing_street field. It does not matter if the value of a student's mailing_street field is 194 Cherry Lane or 24230 Cherry Lane Parkway. If Cherry Lane appears anywhere in the field, PowerSchool considers it a match and includes the record in the search results.Note: You cannot use the contains comparator for numerical fields, such as student numbers.FROM ABOVEThe comparator """"contains"""" is another powerful search tool. For example, you want to find all of the students in your school who live on Cherry Lane. Enter the following search command line:mailing_street contains Cherry LanePowerSchool displays all students with Cherry Lane appearing in the mailing_street field. It does not matter if the mailing_street field is 194 Cherry Lane or 24230 Cherry Lane Parkway; anything that contains Cherry Lane is considered a match.""
""!contain"",""is the search argument not contained in the [field]?"",""The opposite of the contains comparator is """"!contain."""" Use this comparator to find records that do not have the value of the field. Perhaps you want to find all students in your school whose phone numbers do not contain the number five. Use the following search command:home_phone !contain 5This instructs PowerSchool to go through each student record and return the records that do not have 5 in the home_phone field. It does not matter if the number is in the area code, the prefix, or the phone number. If there is not a 5 in the home_phone field, PowerSchool considers it a match and includes the record in the search results.FROM ABOVEThe comparator """"!contain"""" provides another search function. For example, you wanted to find all of the students in your school who do not live on Cherry Lane. Enter the following search command line:mailing_street !contain Cherry LanePowerSchool displays all students with Cherry Lane not appearing anywhere in the mailing_street field. It does not matter if the mailing_street field is 194 Cherry Lane or 24230 Cherry Lane Parkway; anything that contains Cherry Lane is not considered a match.""
""@"",""Wildcard"",""Suppose you want to find all students whose first names start with """"rob."""" This includes anyone named Rob, Robert, Robbie, Robby, Robin, or Roberta. To find these students, enter the following in the search field:first_name=rob@As you can imagine, the wildcard is a very powerful comparator. There is no rule as to where you place it in the command. It can be used anywhere to take the place of a letter, word, or phrase. Enter first_name=@ie to find a student whose first name ends in """"ie."""" This search produces results like Terrie, Debbie, or Eddie but not Terry, Debby, or Eddy. The command first_name=s@n produces results with names such as Susan or Stan.Note: You cannot use the @ or wildcard comparator for numerical fields, such as student numbers.FROM ABOVEThe wildcard """"@"""" provides additional search flexibility. For example, you want to find all of the students whose first names started with jen. Enter the following search command line:first_name = jen@PowerSchool displays all students with the first name that begins with jen.""
```"
"# Special Groups
In addition to simple field/value searching, you may search for special groups, such as ""transferred-in"". With a single command in the search field, you can select a set of students using criteria that would be impossible to reproduce using simple field/value searching, and which would take a significant amount of effort to produce using the ""search in results"" functionality.

```
""Search"",""Who is Selected""
""transferred-in"",""All students who have been transferred into this school, but not yet re-enrolled. In database terms, this means that the """"SchoolID"""" is for the current school, but the """"Enrollment_SchoolID"""" is for some other school, AND that the """"Enroll_Status"""" field is """"2"""" (""""Transferred Out""""). The """"/"""" prefix is implied in this search. This is the equivalent of searching """"/Enroll_Status=2"""", """"&/Enrollment_SchoolID#[my school number]"""".""
```# Search Prefixes
There are three search prefixes you may wish to use. A search prefix adjusts how the search is carried out. Note that you will always follow the prefix by a search term; a prefix is never valid all by itself on the search line.

When the Advanced checkbox is selected, some comparators do not function. You can use the Within button in its place.

```
""Prefix"",""Effect on Search Line""
""/"",""Include non-active students. Normal searches are restricted to the actively enrolled student body of the school. However, especially when transferring students in from another school, you may sometimes wish to locate students who are no longer or not yet active. Use this prefix to search across ALL students (such as active and inactive). Note that this may be placed AFTER (not before) a """"+"""" or """"&"""" prefix.""
""&"",""Search within results. For example, to find all students transferred in after 4/10/2006, search first for """"transferred-in"""", then search for """"&/ExitDate>4/10/2006"""". Note that the """"&"""" must come BEFORE any """"/"""" prefix.""
""+"",""Add results of new search. For example, to find all tenth graders and all ninth graders with the field """"InstrLevel"""" set to """"Advanced"""" you might search for """"Grade_Level=9"""" and then """"&InstrLevel=Advanced"""", and finally for """"+Grade_Level=10"""". Note that the """"+"""" must come BEFORE any """"/"""" prefix.""
```"

"# Student Stored Searches

On this page:

Stored searches find preset groups of students. When storing a search, you are storing the criteria used to search for a group of students, not the list of students' names that result from a search. For example, store a search of all student government representatives to efficiently mark the group as excused when they miss classes due to meetings. Because the names of the representatives can change throughout the year, it is best to store a query that includes all students participating in the government activity. To save a specific list of student names, store the selection instead of the search criteria. 

You can create a stored search or search for students using stored searches already created.

Create a Stored Search
----------------------

To create a stored search that is similar to another stored search, copy the command string from another search and paste it into a new search group. You must then make the necessary changes or additions to the command string for the new group. Run the search to ensure the results are what you expect.

1. Click Stored Searches.
2. Click New.
3. Enter a name for your stored search and paste the command string in the Search Instructions. Or select Fields to choose an option from the field list.

"# Student Stored Selections

On this page:

Store a selection of students or staff to retrieve a group that you work with frequently. Whereas a stored search holds criteria that can result in a varying list of students or staff every time you utilize the stored search, stored selections hold the actual list of students or staff at the time you create the stored selection.

You can create compounded stored selections; that is, use stored selections either to add to other stored selections or create new ones. Since stored selections are user-specific, you manage your own set of stored selections. However, you can publish a stored selection to others in your school.

Stored selections are snapshots of a particular time and do not change when student- or staff-related information changes; therefore, it is suggested that you periodically delete and recreate their stored selections to refresh the data.

4. Click Submit. 

Delete a Stored Selection
-------------------------

You can delete their stored selections, including the stored selections that they publish. Stored selections are snapshots of a particular time and do not change when student- or staff-related information changes; therefore, it is suggested that you periodically delete and recreate their stored selections to refresh the data.

"# Average Final Grades
On this page:

In most cases, final grades are determined by the classroom teacher based on rules defined in the gradebook. This leaves the control over students' grade reporting, and the calculation methodology of those grades, in the hands of the most authoritative source. However, there are times when schedules are set up in a way where administrators want to average grades themselves instead of the teachers or they want to average grades across sections. The final grade averaging function provides school administrators an alternative means of calculating final grades."
"# The Process
The final grade averaging function can be run periodically by the PowerSchool administrator after storing grades. Final grades are calculated using up to six existing stored grades from each unique course taken during the current school year. Unique courses are identified by course number, not course name or section. Consequently, only grades that have been stored via the store grades process or hand-entered with a course number may be used in the calculation.

Once the stored grades for each course have been identified, the GPA points from each grade are averaged and the resulting value is used to create a new stored grade record. The averaging method can either be a simple arithmetic average, which is used by default, or could be weighted using a user-specified method. Each store code may receive a different weight. The weighting scheme used (20/30/50, 1/1/2, 0.2/0.2/0.6) is configurable.

The GPA point value is compared against the grade scale for the course. If an exact match is found, the letter grade corresponding to that value is used. For example, if the three grades A (4.0), B (3.0), and C (2.0) are used, with each weighting 1, the result would be 3. This 3 is looked up in the course's grade scale. An exact match of 3.000 is found, and a new stored grade is created using the letter grade B. However, if the C weighted 2, the result would be 2.75. In this case, there might not be an exact match, so the result would be rounded to the nearest value. In this case, 2.75 would be closer to 2.667 for a letter grade of B-. 

Since multiple letter grades may have identical GPA point values (for example, F, I, NC, and WF all have zero GPA points), the user can exclude certain letter grades from being used. This prevents a zero average from matching to NC on the grade scale. This is necessary because only the GPA point values, not the letter grades themselves, are looked at. The list of excluded letter grades must be recorded for each unique grade scale used.

Once the appropriate letter grade has been identified, absences, tardies, potential credit, earned credit (if the letter grade earns graduation credit), and teacher comments are calculated based on user-defined options. The resulting new grades are stored alongside the student's existing grades and can be printed on report cards and transcripts.# Modify Average Final Grades Settings

"# Class Rank

On this page:

Use class rank to determine the order of students when sorted by grade point average (GPA). For example, the student with the highest GPA ranks at the top of the class. Since class rank calculates based on GPAs, the appropriate GPA calculation methods must exist before determining class rank.

Create a class rank method to set parameters for calculating the class rank. Use multiple class rank methods with varying settings to determine multiple sets of class rankings. For example, you can rank all current students using one method and then rank all current students plus students who graduated early using another method.

Class rank is calculated either manually or automatically at specified intervals, such as every week or only after grades are stored. Since calculating class rank affects all class rank methods, it is best to avoid creating more class rank methods than necessary.

View the results of the class rank calculation using the Class Ranking Report. You can also include class rank data access tags on custom reports and exports. For more information about data codes, see Report Structure.

Manage Class Rank Methods
-------------------------

1. On the start page, choose School under Setup in the main menu.

7. Select how you want to assess the class rank.
8. Select Only include grades to include only grades for courses or sections that count in class rank. When selected, the class rank grade results may differ from GPA calculation results. This is the only class rank method setting that returns a result that may differ from the GPA.
9. Select Exclude students to exclude students that are set as excluded from class rank on the students' Other Information page. Some students may be excluded from class rank because they are enrolled for a short amount of time and should not be ranked amongst longer-term students.
10. Select Include early graduates? to include students that graduate early.
11. Select Early graduation exit code and enter an exit code that specifies early graduation if Include early graduates? is selected.
12. Click Submit.

"# GPA Calculations
On this page:

Before running a grade-related report, such as a report card, set up the correct parameters to calculate your school's grade point average. Some schools also choose to factor into the GPA calculation the number of times a student takes a course. Since GPAs are calculated on the fly, any changes take effect immediately and affect all schools on the server."
"# GPA Calculation Methods
Create GPA calculation methods to define the formula and criteria for GPA calculations. PowerSchool includes four standard calculation methods: Simple, Simple Percent, Weighted, and Weighted Percent. You can modify the standard methods to meet your needs or create an unlimited number of additional calculation methods.

Any changes or additions to the list of calculation methods affect all schools on your server. To share a method with schools on other servers, export the method as a template. If you have the proper permissions, you can remove a calculation method using DDA/DDE. 

Once GPA is calculated, the GPA code is used to present GPA information on reports, exports, and student pages. This code always starts with \*gpa and is followed by optional parameters that include pairs of names and values. 
Examples of the GPA code include: 

* ~(\*gpa) returns the cumulative weighted GPA for a student for all years at the school
* ~(\*gpa method=weighted type=cumulative grade=12 credittypeCORE) returns a weighted GPA for core classes for the student's senior year

The following table lists the parameters and values. All parameters except for ""method"" are overridden by any settings in the calculation method. Parameters and values can be included in the code in any sequence.

```
""Parameter"",""Description"",""Example""
""method"",""Specifies the name of the specific calculation method that should be used when performing this calculation. If omitted, a method called """"weighted"""" will be used."",""method=weighted method=simple method=honors""

"# Add GPA Calculation Methods
Note: As an example of how to set up a GPA Calculation Method, consider a school that is currently in the middle of Quarter 4. It is the school's policy to not store grades until after class has ended, but this year's seniors need a projection of their cumulative GPAs to get an early start on their college applications. To accomplish this, you would set Projected Grades are to Current final grades, Do not add grade if to A grade for the course exist in this term and enter Q4, and Stored Credit Hours to Get potential credit from course.

1. On the start page, choose District under Setup in the main menu. 
2. Under Grading, click GPA Calculations. 
3. Click Calculation Methods.
4. Click New. 
5. Enter the name of the calculation method. This is the name that will be referred to in GPA codes on other pages in PowerSchool.
6. Enter a description of the calculation method. This description appears on the GPA Calculation Methods page.
7. Enter the formula for the method used to determine the result of the calculation. Formulas can include functions, such as average, round, and sum. Use standard operators, such as + (addition) and \* (multiplication), or use logical operators such as \= (equal to) and \> (greater than).
8. Choose a Calculation Type.
    * Cumulative: Uses historical grades in the calculation that match the query options specified.
    * Current: Uses current final grades in the calculation, as determined in the School Setup area. A current calculation type uses the current final grades from the PowerSchool SIS Teacher. Terms, grade levels, and school years are ignored with this calculation type.
    * Projected: Uses historical grades and additional grades as defined in the Projected GPA Options area of the GPA Calculation Method page. A projected calculation type uses historical grades that match the query options specified, plus additional grades determined by any Projected GPA Options.
9. To override the GPA points used in the calculation with a single grade scale, choose a grade scale. If a grade scale is specified, the scale parameter of the GPA code is ignored.
10. Specify one or more term abbreviations, such as Q1 or S2, to use in the calculation. If the calculation type is Current, terms are ignored. If terms are specified, the term parameter of the GPA code is ignored.
11. Specify one or more grade levels to use in the calculation. Use the numeric grade level, such as 11 for the eleventh grade or 0 for kindergarten. If the calculation type is Current, grade levels are ignored. If grade levels are specified, the grade parameter of the GPA code is ignored.
12. Specify one or more four-digit school years to use in the calculation. For example, enter 2003 for the 2003-2004 school year. Separate multiple values with commas. Only grades recorded during the specified school years will be included in the calculation. If the calculation type is Current, school years are ignored. If school years are specified, the year parameter of the GPA code is ignored.
13. Specify one or more credit types to use in the calculation. Separate multiple values with commas. Only grades whose credit type matches one of the types specified will be included in the calculation. If a historical grade does not have a credit type or if the calculation type is Current, the course's credit type is used. If credit types are specified, the credittype parameter of the GPA code is ignored.
14. Select an option for Only include grades if needed:
    * That count in GPA: Includes only historical grades that are specified to be included in the GPA. If the calculation type is Current, only grades from courses and sections that have been flagged to be included in GPA will be included in the calculation.
    * That count in class rank: Includes only historical grades that are specified to be included in the class rank. If the calculation type is Current, only grades from courses and sections that have been flagged to be included in class rank will be included in the calculation.
    * That count in honor roll: Includes only historical grades that are specified to be included in the honor roll. If the calculation type is Current, only grades from courses and sections that have been flagged to be included in honor roll will be included in the calculation.
    * With potential credit: Includes only historical grades that have a potential credit that is not zero. If the calculation type is Current, the potential credit is determined by referring to the corresponding course record.
15. If the calculation type is Projected, choose the type of grades used for projected GPA calculations.
16. If the calculation type is Projected, choose the term for the grade to use in projected GPA calculations. A grade will not be added to the calculation if there already exists a historical grade for the current school year with the same course number for any store code or for the specified store code.
17. If the calculation type is Projected, choose the credit hours option used in projected GPA calculations. If projected grades are historical grades, specify whether to use the actual potential and earned credit stored with the grade or to use the potential credit hours from the corresponding course.

"# Formulas for Calculation Methods
Like a formula in a spreadsheet, create formulas for calculation methods in PowerSchool. Formulas consist of functions and arguments, in most cases. Functions are used to perform operations on values, such as calculating a sum or an average, including a grade point average.

There are five categories of functions:

* Numeric: Such as rounded, truncated by specified number of places
* Logical: Such as ""if,"" ""and,"" ""or""
* Statistical: Such as average, max, min, median, product, sum
* Text: Such as ASCII characters, uppercase, repeat text by specified number of times
* GPA functions: Such as number of grades counted in GPA, course numbers, GPA calculation

Results of GPA functions may be arrays of values, which are in braces and separated by commas. For example, the function gpa\_percent() may return the result {95.5,83.2,67.8,92} for a student. When you combine the gpa\_percent() function with the statistical function average, the formula average(gpa\_percent()) returns the result of 84.625 for those four grades.

Embed functions within each other to return the exact result you want. When appending the Round function to the example above to create the formula round(average(gpa\_percent()),2), the result is 84.63. The value 2 in the formula indicates the number of digits to round from the decimal point.

You can also use any standard numeric or text operators in a formula, such as + (addition), \- (subtraction), \*\*\* (multiplication), / (division), \* (integer division), \*^ (exponentiation), % (modulo), and & (concatenation). The following comparison operators may be used in logical functions: < (less than), <= (less than or equal to), \> (greater than), \>= (greater than or equal to), \= (equal to), and <> (not equal to). For example, use the formula if((average(gpa\_percent()))>90,Outstanding Academic Achievement,) to return the phrase Outstanding Academic Achievement if a student's average percentage for the grades exceeds 90 percent. If not, the formula returns nothing.# GPA Attempt Types
When calculating a student's GPA, you may want to consider the number of times he or she attempts to take a course. An attempt is a numerical expression to determine the length of the term. The name of the attempt type is the first letter of the term abbreviation, such as Y for year or S for semester. The corresponding number is the numeric expression, using decimals for fragments of the term.

Attempt types are used by the gpa\_attempts() function. Attempts for a grade are determined by looking up the first character of the store code or term abbreviation, which is listed with the attempt type. If a match is found, the value specified for the attempt type is returned. If a match is not found, zero is returned as a result of that function."
"# Add GPA Attempt Types

Formulas consist of functions and arguments, in most cases. Functions are used to perform operations on values, such as calculating a sum or an average, including a grade point average (GPA).

There are five categories of functions:

* Numerical functions: Such as rounded, truncated by specified number of places

* Text functions: Such as ASCII characters, uppercase, repeat text by specified number of times
* GPA functions: Such as number of grades counted in GPA, course numbers, GPA calculation

Functions must always include the parentheses, even if no arguments are specified. When specifying arguments to functions, be sure to enclose text values in quotation marks.# GPA Samples
Sample GPA formulas are listed below to illustrate the options available.

PowerSchool's traditional cumulative weighted GPA, rounded to 3 decimal places:

round((gpa\_sum(gpa\_gpapoints()\*gpa\_potentialcredit()/sum(gpa\_potentialcredit()),3)

PowerSchool's traditional cumulative simple GPA, truncated to 2 decimal places:

trunc((average(gpa\_gpapoints()),2)

A value added GPA:

average(gpa\_gpapoints())+sum(gpa\_addedvalue())

The number of A grades received:

countof(A,gpa\_grade())+countof(A+,gpa\_grade())+countof(A-,gpa\_grade())

Total of all earned credit:

sum(gpa\_earnedcredit())

The text ""You are a star student!"" if the student received more than 3 A+ grades:

if(countof(A+,gpa\_grade())>=3,You are a star student!,)

The list of all letter grades, GPA points, and potential credit values used by the calculation:

gpa\_grade()&&gpa\_gpapoints()&&gpa\_potentialcredit()

The result of one GPA calculation if the student has any grades with added value, or the result of another if not:

"# Final Grades Setup

On this page:

Use the Final Grade/Reporting Term Setup page to set up your school's grading terms and parameters. Define the dates of each grading term in the school year and assignment names for which teachers enter final grades for that term. Setting up final grades entry may also be done in the PowerSchool SIS Teacher portal.

Combining schools in situations where both trimester and semester reporting terms are required at one school prevents the use of Term Based Weighting for final grades at that school. When you store final grades at the end of each term, you store a specific final grade, such as Q1. Before you can store final grades, you must set up final grades in PowerSchool. Ensure that the following steps have been completed so that teachers can report their students' grades to PowerSchool. You must set up final grades for each school that shares your PowerSchool server.

After you set up final grades in PowerSchool, the information is automatically sent to each teacher's gradebook. Set up final grades one term at a time. When you set up final grades for a term, you affect only the courses that belong to that term. For example, a first-semester course belongs only to Semester 1; it does not belong to Quarter 1, Quarter 2, or the entire school year. If you do not define the final grade setup for a grading term, teachers will not be able to enter grades in the gradebook. For a tutorial on Final Grade Setup, visit the PowerSchool Community.

Define Final Grade/Reporting Term
---------------------------------

1. On the start page, choose School in the main menu.
2. Click Final Grade/Reporting Term Setup.
3. Click New under the term for which you want to set up final grades. 
4. Enter the Name of the term, such as Q3.
5. Enter the starting and ending dates of the term. 

6. Select Suppress Letter Grade Display to only display percentage grades in the system and on reports. 

7. Select Suppress Percent Display to only display letter grades in the system and on reports. 

8. Enter a value for At or Above This Level of Attendance Points to automatically affect students' grades due to attendance. Then, enter the grade that students receive after meeting or exceeding the attendance points for Change a Student's Grade to.
9. Click Submit.

Course Prerequisite Rules and Graduation Plan Progress
------------------------------------------------------

Enter the number of days before or after the term ends that you want the course prerequisite rule evaluator to presume completion and graduation plans to specify the enrollment as in progress. This number allows the administrator a set number of days between the end of a term and the storage of grades for that term. A negative number allows specification of the number of days before the day the enrollment ends, for instances where the school typically records grades prior to enrollments ending. 

1. On the start page, choose School in the main menu.
2. Click Final Grade/Reporting Term Setup.
3. Enter the appropriate Days Before/After Term End value.
4. Click Submit. "
"# Grade Scales
On this page:

Create multiple grade scales and assign them to different courses or sections. For example, grades for AP Calculus count more towards a student's GPA than grades for Basic Math. Assign the two courses to different grade scales. You can also assign grade scales to courses.

The grade scales you define become the set of grades that are possible to use at all schools on your PowerSchool system. The value of a grade is determined when a historical grade is given to a student taking a particular course. Even if the grade scale for that course changes, the values of that student's grade do not change.

When viewing grade scales, a Class Grade Scales Exist column appears and indicates district grade scales that have active teacher-created class grade scales.

You can view a list of teachers and sections that have custom grade scales created from a district grade scale.

1. Click Edit, then select Teacher List.

2. Click View next to a class grade scale to review the class grade scales created from the district grade scale."
"# Planning Your Grade Scales
Determine the different elements of the grade scale prior to creating a new alpha or numeric grade scale.# Grading Types
When you create a grade scale, you can make it available for different grade types. You can use grade scales with traditional grades, standards grades, or a mix of both traditional and standards grades."
"# Color Levels
Grade scales include color levels for each item in the scale that provide a visual indicator of student progress that can be consistent and aligned across all different types of grade scales. These color levels are used in other parts of PowerSchool, such as in the At-Risk Student Dashboard in PowerSchool or on the Class Progress page in PowerTeacher Pro. When you create a new grade scale, select the number of colors associated with the grade scale. Once you generate the grade scale table, select the color level for each grade. Available colors include dark green, green, yellow, orange, and red. Depending on the number of items in the grade scale, the color levels may include different shades of these colors.

In an A, B, C, D, F grade scale:

* Dark green - Equates to a grade of A
* Green - Equates to a grade of B
* Yellow - Equates to a grade of C
* Orange - Equates to a grade of D
* Red - Equates to a grade of F

These color levels appear in PowerTeacher Pro. Select the number of colors you want to appear associated with this grade scale. Grade scale color levels provide a visual indicator of student progress that can be consistent and aligned across all different types of grade scales.

Divide the grade scale into 2-5 color groups for easy color identification for teachers. The colors appear in PowerTeacher Pro graphs and charts and display clear demarcation of proficiency.# Repeated Course Policy
You can select a repeated course grade suppression policy for a grade scale. If enabled, stored grades associated with this grade scale will be evaluated based on the selected repeated course grade suppression policy during the permanently store grades process."
"# Scale Used in GAP and Course Credit
If you are using traditional grades, you can choose if you want GPA and Course Credit used with this scale. You can also specify if the grade scale counts in the student's GPA, and the specific number of grade points to include in the GPA.

You can also select if you want teachers to be able to enter an added value for a grade that exceeds the normal grade points.# Show Term Weighting and Average Final Grades
You can choose if you want Term Weighting Points and Average Final Grades visible to the teacher when using this grade scale.

Combining schools in situations where both trimester and semester reporting terms are required at one school prevents the use of Term Based Weighting for final grades at that school."
"# Alpha Grade Scales
An alpha grade scale uses letter grades such as A, B, and C+ or E, S, and N, or descriptive grades such as Excellent, Satisfactory, and Unsatisfactory. With the exception of some new options, alpha grade scales are largely unchanged for PowerTeacher Pro.

* Traditional scales - A,B,C,D,F
* Elementary school - Outstanding, Satisfactory, Need Improvement (O,S,N), or alpha-based proficiency scale: Exceeds, Meets, Approaching, Basic (E,M,A,B)





* GPA and Credit - Show or hide these fields as needed.
* Term Weighting - Average final grades or term weighting points. Show or hide these fields as needed.# Create an Alpha Grade Scale
Once you have planned the grade scale, you can create the alpha grade scale when you are signed in to the District office.

1. On the start page, choose District > Grading.
2. Click Grade Scales, then click New.
3. Select Alpha from the Type menu.
4. Enter the Starting Grade Scale Items grades you would like to populate in the Grade Scale table. Use commas to separate values, for example A+, A, A-, B+, B, B-, etc.
5. Click Generate Table.
6. Modify details of the grade scale in the Grade Scale table or click Add Grade to include an additional grade.
7. To remove a grade from the scale, click the minus (remove) button.

```# Numeric Grade Scales
While numeric conversion scales already exist for standards grade calculation in PowerTeacher Gradebook, numeric grade scales are new for use in PowerTeacher Pro and can be used for both course grades and standards grades. As indicated at the beginning of this document, existing numeric conversion scales will be migrated as numeric grade scales.

Like a numeric conversion scale, a numeric grade scale is a number range (for example, 1-4). Usually, each number represents a level of proficiency. For example, 4=advances, 3=proficient, 2=approaching, 1=below. Numeric grade scales now allow calculations with just those numbers. For example, scores of 3 and 4 will average to 3.5. No percent conversion is needed.

Some districts want intermediary levels between whole numbers, for example 4, 3.5 and 3, or 4, 3+, and 3. You can do this without needing every other decimal. An example of a 1-4 scale with plus is 4, 3+, 3, 2+, 2, 1+,1. Alternately, you can include multiple decimal values. For example, a one decimal scale would have 3, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, etc.Special grades, like W or I, can still be used by creating a Special Codes grade scale."
"# Converting Other Scales into a Numeric Scale
In some cases, it is necessary to convert a grade from one grade scale to another where each scale is made up of different items. For example, when scoring assignments in PowerTeacher Pro where the section grade scale is different than the related standard grade scale and the assignment is configured to auto-calculate standard scores from the overall score.

* Use cut-offs: Compares the incoming percentage to Cutoff % To Numeric values in this scale to determine which one of the distinct numeric grades to convert.
* Use % value ratios: Determine how far between the Cutoff % To Numeric values the incoming percentage falls in order to convert to a more precise, equidistant numeric grade.# Category Totals Or Term Weighting Calculation
Numeric grade scales can use a different calculation method for category totals and term weighting for the overall course grade."
"# Use Percent Earned
The Use Percent Earned calculation method for category totals calculates the final grade as a weighted average of the actual percentages earned from assignment categories contributing to the final grade.

```

"# Special Codes
Special Codes are new for PowerTeacher Pro, and while similar in some respects to Score Codes in PowerTeacher Gradebook, they have extended functionality.

When you associate a regular grade scale with a special codes scale, teachers can access all of the items on both scales.

Teachers can assign special codes as final course grades. For example, a teacher can use the special code to mark a final course grade as NC (no credit). However, special codes are never the result of a final grade calculation.

Special codes can also be used for assignment scoring. For example, a teacher marks an assignment as ABS to indicate that the student was absent for the assignment or uses another code to award a pre-defined percentage of the total points possible.# Create a Special Codes Grade Scale

---------------------------------------------

On the Complete Academic Record Detail View page, select a grade to edit it. You can change the Grade Suppression Code that was set during the Permanently Store Grades process. To prevent grade calculations from changing this value, set the Grade Suppression Calculation to Exclude. If excluded, the Repeated Course Grade Suppression calculation will ignore this value.

When editing a stored grade, use the Grade Suppression Code menu and select:

* Replaced Grade (R) to indicate the stored grade replaces a course grade.
* Over Maximum Credit (M) to indicate maximum credit hours. 

The selection does not automatically adjust whether the stored grade is excluded from transcripts, GPA, honor roll, class rank, or graduation calculations. However, you can change these settings manually.

Override the Grade Suppression Policy
-------------------------------------

On the New Stored Grade page, the Academic Record Entry page, or the Edit Stored Grade page, use the Grade Suppression Policy Override menu to override the section or course's Grade Suppression Policy. The selected policy determines how the Permanently Store Grades process uses the stored grades associated with this grade scale. For more information, refer to Historical Grades.

Add a Replaced Grade to a Transcript Object Report
--------------------------------------------------

Navigate to the Object Reports page, and add or edit a Transcript object. On this page, you can include replaced grades in the object report. Open the Columns Field menu and select Replaced Grade. Enter the grade indicator you want to print in the Other Field/Text/Format field. To indicate replaced grades, enter R. To indicate grades suppressed because they were over the maximum credit hours for the course, enter M.

"# Historical Grades
On this page:

Historical Grades in PowerSchool student records include two types of grades: current and historical. Current grades are students' grades entered by each of their teachers through PowerTeacher Gradebook. Current grades change with each new assignment that teachers enter in PowerTeacher Gradebook. Teachers, administrators, and parents use current grades to track student progress throughout a grading term.

Historical grades are final grades or grades that are permanently stored in the student's record. At the end of each grading term, your PowerSchool administrator copies and stores the students' current grades from PowerTeacher Gradebook to historical grades. Historical grades appear on report cards and transcripts.

This function displays your selected student's grades from previous terms. You have the choice of using a normal view or a detail view.

Note: The Historical Grades student page view is view-only for most users; only those with proper access, such as a school counselor, have the right to edit historical grades. Teachers who assign grades and need to change them later must contact a user with the proper access."

"# Honor Roll Administration
On this page:

The ability to calculate your honor roll based on grading, behavior, or attendance information is important to a school. Every school has its own way of calculating or determining who is on the honor roll and who is eligible for extracurricular activities.

First, define the various honor roll lists used by a school or district. Within those lists, set up the different honor levels that may be attained and the criteria for meeting each level. Once the setup is complete, the PowerSchool administrator should run the calculation function periodically throughout the school year. The results of the calculation are stored in a separate table in the database. These results can be viewed as a summary for a single student, a group report, or as individual components of a custom page, export, or custom report using report codes.

Honor Roll Methods

Honor roll methods define the various honor roll lists used by a school or district. You can create as many different honor roll methods as needed. Honor roll methods can be school-specific or shared among all schools on a server.

Honor Roll Levels

Every honor roll method will contain one or more honor roll levels. The evaluation order of honor roll levels is significant. Typically, the highest honor with the most stringent criteria is evaluated first. If a student does not meet the criteria for that level, the criteria for the next highest honor will be evaluated, and so on. If a student meets the criteria for an honor roll level, a record of that honor is created and the remaining levels are skipped.

The evaluation of the criteria within each honor roll level is cumulative, meaning a student must meet all of the specified options to receive that honor. You can create as many different honor roll levels as needed.

Honor Roll Calculations

Once the honor roll methods and levels have been set up, you can calculate an honor roll at any time."
"# Create an Honor Roll Method
Note: Honor rolls that use a GPA Calculation Type of Current (Start Page > District Setup > GPA Calculations > Calculation Methods > New > Calculation Type = Current) must have a term set up that matches the Final Grade setup. For example, if an Honor Roll for the Q1 Final Grade is used, not only is a Q1 Final Grade needed, but a Q1 term setup in years and terms is also needed.

1. On the start page, choose School under Setup in the main menu. 
2. Under Grading, click Honor Roll. 
3. Click New. 
4. Enter the name of the honor roll method. This is the name that will be referred to in honor roll report codes and on other menu pages.

7. Click Submit. 
8. Click Levels next to the method you just created. 
9. Click New. 
10. Enter the name of the honor roll level. This is the level name that appears on report pages and is the default value returned by the honor roll report code. This name does not need to be unique, allowing you to define multiple sets of criteria for a given level.
11. Enter a description.
12. Enter a value specifying the order in which the various honor roll levels will be evaluated. Lower numbers are evaluated first.
13. Enter the message you want to appear on report cards and transcripts.
14. Choose the GPA calculation method. The GPA calculation method is used for two things: determining a GPA value that may be compared against a specified cutoff value and building a list of letter grades that will be used in the Grade Options settings described below. Every honor roll level must specify a GPA calculation method.
15. Choose whether the comparison should be numeric or text.
16. Choose the comparator to use when comparing the result of the GPA calculation. Enter the cutoff value in the provided field. If you do not want to compare the value of the GPA calculation, leave the cutoff value field blank.
17. Select Only include grades to override the settings used in the GPA calculation method so that any grades that have been flagged to be excluded from honor roll are not used in the calculation or returned in the list of grades for the grade options.

18. Choose the comparator to use when comparing the total of the potential credit hours from the list of grades returned by the GPA calculation. Enter the cutoff value.
19. Choose the comparator to use when comparing the total of the earned credit hours from the list of grades returned by the GPA calculation. Enter the cutoff value.
20. Choose the comparator to use when comparing the number of unique course numbers found in the list of grades returned by the GPA calculation. Enter the cutoff value.
21. Choose a comparison for the Grade Options and enter a comma-separated list of letter grades:

    * At least: There must be at least <the specified number> of any of the grades below in the list of grades returned by the GPA calculation
    * No more than: There cannot be any more than <the specified number> of any of the grades below in the list of grades returned by the GPA calculation
    * Exactly: There must be no more than and no less than <the specified number> of any of the grades below in the list of grades returned by the GPA calculation
    * None: There cannot be any of the grades below in the list of grades returned by the GPA calculation
    * Only: There must be only the grades below in the list of grades returned by the GPA calculation.

"# Honor Roll Codes
The honor roll code returns data based on honor roll calculations that are periodically run by the PowerSchool administrator. The honor roll code provides an easy way to access the stored data when working with a single student, such as a custom student page, quick export, or object report.

The basic syntax of the honor roll code is illustrated by the examples below. The code always starts with \*honorroll and is followed by several parameters (name/value pairs). These parameters are always of the form name=value. Certain parameters are required. All other parameters are optional and default values will be used if omitted.

~(\*honorroll method=High School term=Q2) 
~(\*honorroll method=NHS term=S1 year=2002 result=gpa) 
~(\*honorroll method=Honors term=Q2 grade=11) 


The following table lists the parameters, values, and examples for the honor roll code. Parameters and values can be included in the code in any sequence.

```
""Parameter"",""Description"",""Example""
""Method"",""Specifies the name of the honor roll method to return. These methods are predefined by the user in the Honor Roll section of school setup. The method parameter is required. If omitted, an error message is returned."",""method=High Schoolmethod=NHS""
""Term"",""A single term abbreviation. Specifies the store code of the appropriate honor roll record. The term parameter is required. If omitted, an error message is returned."",""term=S1term=Q3""
""Grade"",""A single grade level. For KG, PK, use the numeric code 0, -1, and so forth. Specifies the historical grade level of the appropriate honor roll record. Note that grade and year are often mutually exclusive and the use of both parameters in the code may cause no record to be found. If no grade or year parameter is specified, will find an honor roll record from the current school year."",""grade=12grade=8""
""year"",""A single four-digit school year. Remember that school years in PowerSchool are specified using the start year. For example, for the 2003-2004 school year, use 2003. Specifies the school year of the appropriate honor roll record. Note that grade and year are often mutually exclusive and the use of both parameters in the code may cause no record to be found. If no grade or year parameter is specified, will find an honor roll record from the current school year."",""year=2003year=2004""
""Result"",""The type of data to return as the result. Valid options are level, message, gpa, schoolname, and date. Level means return the name of the honor roll level met. Message means return the text message for the honor roll level. GPA means return the GPA used to determine the honor roll level. Schoolname means return the name of the school where the student earned the honor roll. Date means return the date the honor roll was calculated. If omitted, level is returned. Note that if no honor roll is found that matches the parameters specified, no text will be returned regardless of the result setting."",""result=levelresult=messageresult=gparesult=schoolnameresult=date""

"# Permanently Store Grades
In PowerSchool, student records include two types of grades: current and historical. Current grades are the students' grades in each of their teachers' PowerTeacher systems. Historical grades are final grades, or grades that are permanently stored in the students' records. Historical grades appear on report cards and transcripts. At the end of each grading term, use the Permanently Store Grades function to copy and store the students' current grades in PowerTeacher as historical grades.

By default, PowerSchool administrators have 30 calendar days after the term end date to store or re-store grades. The ""term end date"" refers to the end of the scheduling term associated to a given class. For example, when storing Q1 grades for a Quarter 1 class, administrators have until 30 days after the last day of Quarter 1 to store those grades. However, when storing Q1 grades for Year Long classes, administrators have until 30 days after the end of the year to store those grades. For more information, see Final Grades Setup. Changes to grades beyond the 30 days within the current school year term, can also be performed using the Show All Terms setting.

Note: Changes to grades beyond the 30 days, but not within the current school year term, would need to be performed either manually on the student's Historical Grades page or by importing the grades.

Before permanently storing grades, be sure that you set up grade scales, final grades, and the current grade display. 

Also, you should run several reports before permanently storing grades. The Student Schedule Listing report lists the current grades and any missing grades for selected students. For more information, see Run the Student Schedule Listing Report. Print the Class Rosters report for teachers to verify that all the grades are correct. For more information, see Run the Class Rosters (PDF) Report.

Warning: Be sure to use this feature carefully, as storing grades affects historical grades, which affect various parts of PowerSchool, including (but not limited to) GPAs, transcripts, and graduation progress.

Note: This procedure may only be performed at the school level.

To complete this procedure, follow these steps:

1. On the start page, choose System under Setup in the main menu. 
2. Under Grades, click Permanently Store Grades. 
3. Enter a two or three-digit code or select a code to indicate the term in which the students earned the grades, such as Q1 or S1. The first character must be a letter, and the second and third characters must be a number. This value is stored as TermBinsName in the StoredGrades table and is accessible using DDA, DDE, importing, and exporting.

4. Enter the term code from which you want to save the grades. The term code is usually the same as the store code, such as Q1 or S1.
5. Using the Exclude/Include Class Enrollments section, you can store current grades based on students' enrollment or dropped class dates. If you leave the date-related fields blank, PowerSchool stores a grade for every enrollment record, including classes that students dropped during the term. Most schools enter a two-week grace period at both the beginning and end of the term. This allows for all of the add/drop procedures at the beginning of the term to be ignored in the store grades process. Also, PowerSchool does not store grades for students who enroll in your school during the last two weeks of the term. You can select any combination of the following:
    * Select Exclude enrollment records where the student enrolled in the class after this date and enter the date.
    * Select Exclude enrollment records where the student dropped the class before this date and enter the date.
    * Select Include only enrollment records that are currently active and that were active on this date and enter the date.
6. Enter Additional Filter Options. Additional Filter Options include:
    * Store grades for currently selected () students only to filter by student selection
    * Request that grades be stored only for a specific section to store grades for students in a specific course section only, enter the course and section numbers, separated by a period. For example, enter 113.04 for Course 113, Section 04. You can do this when teachers are late in entering their final grades or when testing the process of storing grades. Store grades for one course section before you store grades for all course sections.
    * Student Grade Level to filter by grade level
    * Track to filter by track
    * School Exit Date to filter by exit date range (the first day the student's enrollment is not active or the day after the student's last day in class). Enter the date range by which you want to filter the storing selection, or click the Calendar icon to select a date. This setting does not find students who were enrolled through the specified range but finds students whose school exit date falls within the specified range.
7. For each term, choose a Store method. If Store with credit is selected, enter a percentage of the course credit to award at the time grades are permanently stored. If Store with no credit is selected, the field is automatically populated with a 0 which cannot be updated.
8. Select Yes for Show All Terms? to show all terms for the current school year term. By default terms that are in progress or recently passed appear. If you are storing grades for a term that is not in progress or recently passed, you may need to display all terms. If a term was already stored, you will overwrite the grades for that term which may affect graduation credit, GPAs, and transcripts. 

9. Select whether to store grades for all schools or for the selected school only. For example, if a middle school student takes a class at the high school, the middle school must select this option when permanently storing grades. When storing grades for students taking classes at other schools, the TermID fields must match between the schools for those enrollments to store correctly.
10. Select which school name to use when storing grades.
11. Select Options for withholding credit to apply options for withholding credit. If selected, a student may be allowed to miss a certain number of classes. However, if the student exceeds the allowable attendance points, then the student will not receive credit for the course and any credit they had earned will be cleared. If you have selected this option, complete the following: 

    1. Enter the number of times a student is allowed to miss a class.
    2. Enter the date range of the course.
    3. Enter the grade the student will receive if the attendance points are exceeded.
    4. Enter a value of zero or higher to replace any existing GPA point value for the affected grades or leave blank if you do not want to replace any existing GPA point value for the affected grades.
    5. Enter a comment if you want the original grade the student earned to appear with the comment.



12. Choose the options you want to apply for storing potential and earned credit for Advanced Potential and Earned Credit Options.

13. Indicate which credit hours you want to store under Variable Credit Storing Preferences. These options only apply if variable credit is enabled. Variable credit may be enabled for an individual section or for multiple sections.
14. Select an option for Store this when teacher has not entered variable credit hours to determine how to handle variable credit where no value has been entered by teachers.
15. Select an option for Round or truncate to determine how to handle variable credit values entered by teachers.
16. Choose the Number of decimal places in variable credit hours.
17. Indicate whether to Apply Repeated Course Grade Suppression Policy Rules. If enabled, stored grades related to grade scales that allow repeated course grade suppression will be evaluated by the repeated course grade suppression rules during the permanently store grades process."

"# Set Max Credit Hours for a Course
Using the Edit Course District Information page, you can set the maximum number of credits a student receives for taking the course in the Max Credit Hours field. The value must be greater than or equal to the Credit Hours. Once a value is entered, the value will be evaluated against the credit earned on stored grades to determine if it should be excluded from graduation progress/graduation planner based on the association to the grade policy related to the grade scale for the course or section.

Note: For more information, see Edit District Course Information.# Set Repeated Course Grade Suppression for a Grade Scale
Using the New Grade Scale or the Edit Grade Scale page, you can enable the Repeated Course Grade Suppression by choosing a repeated course grade suppression policy. If enabled, stored grades associated to this grade scale will be evaluated based on the selected repeated course grade suppression policy during the permanently store grades process.

Note: For more information, see Grade Scales."
"# Set Up Course Equivalencies
Using the Course Equivalencies page, you can manage the relationship between a course and its equivalent. For example, if EHS101 (course) and EHS102 (course equivalent) are stored, then EHS102 courses can replace EHS101 grades. EHS102 is ""equivalent to"" EHS101. Once defined, course equivalencies are then used by the repeated course grade suppression process when calculating permanently store grades.

Note: For more information, see Edit Course Equivalencies.# Ensure Historical Grade Levels Set for School
The Repeated Course Grade Suppression process operates on StoredGrades Records, which have a grade level associated with them. To properly ensure that the correct group of records are being evaluated, the group is constrained by the high and low Historical Grade Levels settings for the school in which you are running the process. It is important to have these values set so you don't replace middle school grade records with high school grade records, for example, or count middle school credit towards max credit at the high school. This could happen if a common course number spans these schools.

If the school has a low historical grade level set to 9, then any record considered must have grade\_level set to 9 or above. If the low historical grade level is not set, then no check against low grade is performed.

If the school has a high historical grade level set to 12, then any record considered must have grade\_level set to 12 or below. If the high historical grade level is not set, then no check against high grade is performed.

So, if the school has no low historical grade level, but a high historical grade level of 12, then all storedgrades records of Grade\_level 12 or below will be considered in the process.

Additionally, using Course Equivalencies, you can manage the relationship between a course and its equivalent. Once defined, course equivalencies are then used by the repeated course grade suppression process when calculating permanently store grades.

Example 1

Semester 1 a student receives a grade of F and in Semester 2 the student receives a grade of B. The F will be replaced by the B meaning the F will be excluded from graduation, class rank, honor roll, and GPA calculations. Additionally, the F will have a repeated course grade suppression value of 'R', indicating that it was replaced by a better grade.

Example 2

A course has a maximum credit hours setting of 1. A student takes the class three times in different semesters, each of which one credit was attempted. The student received the following grades in the following order: C, F, B. The C will replace the F and the B will be set as over maximum credit for the course. The F will be excluded from graduation, class rank, honor roll and GPA calculations. Additionally, the F will have a repeated course grade suppression value of 'R', indicating that it was replaced by a better grade. The B will be excluded from graduation and it will receive a repeated course grade suppression value of 'M', indicating it was suppressed because the student had already received the maximum number of credits allowed for that course.

Example 3

Semester 1 a student receives a grade of F for course number MATH101 and in Semester 2 the student receives a grade of B for course number MATH102. An equivalency is defined for MATH102 where it can replace MATH101. The B will replace the F where the F will be excluded from graduation, class rank, honor roll and GPA calculations. Additionally, the F will have a repeated course grade suppression value of ""R"", indicating that it was replaced by a better grade. The MATH102 record will have its Replaced\_Equivalent\_Course field set to MATH101 to indicate that it is replacing a different ""equivalent course""."

"# Repeated Course Grade Suppression Rules
PowerSchool supports the following repeated course grade suppression rules:

* When running the repeated course grade suppression process, it looks to see if the grade is related to a grade scale that has the repeated course grade suppression policy enabled. If so, then the broader StoredGrades table is searched for grades for the same student and course or course equivalency.
* Only grades that have potential or earned credit will be evaluated.
* GPA points are used to determine which grades are better than others and can therefore replace other grades.
* As grades are evaluated, they are processed in groups based on having the same StudentID and Course\_Number. They are processed in the order of oldest to newest (based on yearID, and ending Term Bin date). As they are processed, earned credits are tallied to help determine if when some grades can be replaced and when the student is over the maximum credit for the course.
* If store codes are specified in the policy, then only grades with those store codes will be evaluated.
* Grades with a GPA point <= than the low threshold can always be replaced by a grade with a higher GPA point value.
* Grades with a GPA point above the low threshold and <= the high threshold are only replaced by a better grade if the grades processed so far have a sum of earned credits equal to or greater than the maximum credit for the course.
* Grades cannot replace other grades with the same TermID unless specified in the policy to ignore this restriction.
* Once the sum of the earned credits is equal to or greater than the maximum credit for the course, and if that grade cannot be replaced, then that grade will be excluded from graduation and it will set the historical grade repeated course grade suppression value to M signifying it was suppressed because the student was over the maximum credits for the course. Based on the policy, these grades may also be excluded from GPA, class rank, honor roll, or transcripts.
* When a grade replaces another grade, then the replaced grade will be excluded from graduation. Based on the policy, the replaced grade may also be excluded from GPA, class rank, honor roll, or transcripts. It will also have a repeated course grade suppression value of R indicating that it was replaced by another grade. Then a correlation is made as to which grade replaced it. This is based on the hidden DCID value of the replacing grade that gets populated in the replaced grades Replacing\_DCID field.
* Older grades can replace newer grades and newer grades can replace older grades.
* If the process is run multiple times and data or settings change, grades that were previously flagged as repeated or over maximum credit will have these values removed and will no longer being excluded from graduation. Additionally, the settings to be excluded from class rank, honor roll, and GPA will revert back to how the permanently store grades process sets these values without the effects of the repeated course grade suppression rules.
* The repeated course grade suppression logic will always try to replace grades that will give the student the best GPA result. However, when grades are at maximum, the latter grades are suppressed even if they are better than previous grades that have a GPA point value too high to be replaced.
* A grade cannot replace two grades. It is always a one to one relationship. However, a grade can replace another grade that has already replaced something else.

Note: For more information on the precise calculation logic, see Knowledgebase article 70584."

"# Standards
On this page:

Before using standards in PowerSchool, understand what your district wants and is expected to report to a board of education, superintendent, or the state Department of Education (DOE). There is no need to define different standards or benchmarks at every grade level if you are not expected to report that information. For example, the Wyoming DOE requires schools to report student progress at the fourth-, eighth-, and eleventh-grade levels. Schools in Wyoming often select to have all teachers match their assignments to only those benchmarks unless their local DOE requires it at every grade level. Kindergarten through fourth-grade teachers can align to the fourth-grade set of benchmarks; fifth- through eighth-grade teachers can align to the eighth-grade set; and so on.

Important: If each grade level does use and report on different standards, then standards should be created by grade level."
"# Grading Methods
The conversion scales are applied in the grading methods listed in the following table. In specialized cases, these methods need special values in order to translate into a different scale.

```
""Grading Method"",""Description""
""Values and Cut-offs"",""This is the main way that alphanumeric scales work. Every letter has a grade value. Those values are averaged together then the cut-off is used to determine the final grade. For example: A = 100, B= 80. Student has A, A, B (value = 100, 100, 80). Average = 92.5%. The cut-off for A is 90, so the final grade is A. There are two scenarios where a numeric scale uses a value and cut-off.""
""Basic Numbers"",""This is the main way that numeric scales work. Basic numbers have no special values. For example: 4, 4, 3, 3 = 4, 4, 3, 3. Average = 3.5. There are two scenarios where a numeric scale does not use basic numbers. In order to calculate the grade correctly, you create Translation Values.""
```# Standards Scenarios
The grade scales calculation in PowerTeacher Pro is dependent on the preferences the teacher has set on the Standards Grades Calculations page in PowerTeacher Pro.

If no calculation preferences are set:

```
""Standards Scenario"",""Alphanumeric Scale"",""Numeric Scale""
""Using assignment standard scores to calculate the final standards grade."",""Uses values and cut-offs to calculate the final standards grade. Every letter has a grade value. The grade values are added, then the cut-off is used to determine the final grade."",""Uses basic numbers with no special values.""
```

If preference is set to calculate the higher level standards grades from lower level standards grades:

```
""Standards Scenario"",""Alphanumeric Scale"",""Numeric Scale""
""Rolling up standards final grades to the higher level standards, when all lower level standards have the same scale."",""Uses values and cut-offs to calculate the final standards grade. Every letter has a grade value. The grade values are added, then the cut-off is used to determine the final grade."",""Uses basic numbers with no special values.""
""Rolling up standards final grades to the higher level standards, when some of lower level standards have different types of grade scales."",""Uses values and cut-offs to calculate the final standards grade. Every letter has a grade value. The grade values are added, then the cut-off is used to determine the final grade."",""Uses the grade value and cut-off to use the values and cut-offs grading method.""
```

If preference is set to allow assignment scores to auto-calculate the assignment standards scores:

```
""Standards Scenario"",""Alphanumeric Scale"",""Numeric Scale""
""Pushing scores from the assignment to the standards scores."",""Uses values and cut-offs to calculate the assignment standard scores. Every letter has a grade value. The cut-off is used to determine the assignment standards score."",""If the same scale is used for the section's traditional grade as well as the standards being assessed, then basic numbers with no special values are used. If however the scales differ, then the translation values and cutoffs are used.""
```"
"# Standards Calculation Measures
Here are five example scores, an explanation of each calculation option, and a discussion of when each option might be a good or a bad choice for your class.

```
""Example Score"",""Calculation Method"",""Calculation Score Result""
""Scores on five assignments:2, 3, 3, 3, 4"",""Mean (average of the scores)"",""3""
""Weighted Mean (average of the scores, weighted by points possible)"",""3 (but depends on the weighted points possible for the assignments)""
""Median (middle score)"",""3""
""Mode (most frequently occurring score)"",""3Note: When there is more than one mode, this score will be blank.""
""Highest (highest score)"",""4""
""Most Recent (average of the most recent scores)"",""Most Recent 1 score: 4Most Recent 2 scores: 3.5(average of 3 and 4)Most Recent 3 scores: 3.33(average of 3, 3, and 4)You can also set a weight for each of the most recent scores on the Preferences dialog.For example, set the most recent calculation to use the last 3 scores. You want the most recent to be 50%, and the 2 before to each be 25% of the calculation.You can also set a weight for each of the most recent scores on the Preferences dialog.For example, set the most recent calculation to use the last 3 scores. You want the most recent to be 50%, and the 2 before to each be 25% of the calculation.""
```


Every measure has times when it is valuable, and times where it may not be the best measure for your class."
"# Calculation Method Description
The following table lists the calculation methods available.

```
""Calculation Method"",""When to Use It"",""When Not to Use It""
""Mean"",""When you have equally important scores at each period of time, and the learning is not cumulative. For example, in History, final unit test scores on unit 1, unit 2, and unit 3 may all be independent. In that case, using the mean (or average) could be a good choice."",""When students are introduced to a new concept and the learning is cumulative over time. For example, students start out not understanding a concept, but over the term they get it. Averaging their initial scores (where they were unfamiliar with the work) with their final attempts (when they understood the concepts) may not be the best measure. For example, consider the following scores: 20%, 30%, 40%, 95%, 100%. In this case, the student likely did not understand the concept at the beginning, but by the end they got it. The average here is 57%, which may not be the most reflective of their proficiency at the end of the term.""
""Weighted Mean"",""The weighted mean is better than the mean when assignments with high weighted points possible should be counted more heavily."",""When all standards scores are valid indicators of performance, the teacher may not care about the specific points possible. This is especially true if there are high point value assignments from early in the semester, and the students have grown tremendously since that time.""
""Median"",""When you have multiple data points, and students have been given lots of chances to demonstrate mastery. It allows the student to overcome their initial attempts when they don't understand at the beginning, because only the middle score is used. Some people consider this one of the most consistent measures of performance. This measure throws out high and low outlying scores. For this reason, housing price data is usually listed in terms of the median sales price. There are extremes at either end that can skew average."",""When there are only a few data points. In that case, the middle number can simply be luck. Or, when the learning is cumulative, where the students know much more at the end of the term, and their proficiency is significantly better across the board than at the start. For example, consider the following scores: 20%, 30%, 40%, 95%, 100%. In this case, the student likely did not understand the concept at the beginning, but by the end they got it. The median (or middle number) here is 40%, and may not be the most reflective of their proficiency at the end of the term.""
""Mode"",""When you have a small range of possibilities. For example, when using letter grades A,B,C,D,F, or a 1-4 scale, there are only a limited range of score options. If a student's scores are A, D, A, B, A, the most frequently occurring value is A."",""When there are multiple possible scores, and it is unlikely for the exact score to be consistent. For example, this is not a good measure for percentage scores. Example percentage scores: 90, 91, 25, 100, 99, 81.5, 98, 97, 25, 96, 94. In this data, the mode is 25%. The average is 81.5%. The median is 94%.""
""Highest"",""When the student's highest level of demonstrated proficiency is a good indicator of what they know and can do. When assessments are in-depth and highly reliable. In these cases, many districts believe that the student's highest score is a good indicator."",""When the highest score could be based on chance or lucky guessing. For example, on multiple choice tests, the student could have guessed right on several questions by chance, boosting their highest score. For example, one student's results for one standard assessed on 5 multiple choice tests were as follows: 70, 95, 70, 70, 70. Although the student did get a 95 once, this score may not be the best reflection of the student's actual level of proficiency on this standard.""
""Most Recent"",""When the learning is cumulative, and the students will demonstrate a much higher level of proficiency at the end of the term than at the beginning. In these cases, it makes sense to focus on the most recent scores as a reflection of the student's proficiency."",""When some of most recent scores themselves are anomalies. For example, if a student recently was very ill, or experienced some other phenomenon, then the most recent scores may not be reflective of their actual proficiency. This is usually assessed student by student to determine if the most recent scores are accurate. It can also happen when the most recent assessment is not as detailed or reliable as earlier assessments, or there were other distracting factors. For example, students have lots of good quizzes and a unit test with reliable data. That was followed by in-class review worksheets. Half of the students were distracted completing them because there was construction going on outside. In this case, the most recent data may not be the most reflective.""
""Specific Weight"",""Values entered in the weight field for standards related to the course are used to determine which standards grades will be averaged to produce the course grade as well as how much each standard grade will be weighted in that calculation."",""If you want to weigh all of the standards assessed by the student to determine a final grade. For calculating a final standards grade, you want all direct child standards to calculate to the parent. For calculating a final traditional grade from standards, you want all standards assessed for the student to be included in the calculation.""
""Specific Sum"",""For use with numeric grade scales. Values entered in the weight field for standards related to the course are used to determine which numeric standard grades will be summed to produce a numeric course grade, as well as how many times they will be counted. For example: The course standard has a weight of 2, numeric value of the standard grade is 3, sum value for that standard grade is 6. Course or section grades scales will often allow higher numeric values than those assigned to the standards being summed to allow for more meaningful summed totals. For example: A standard has a numeric 1-4 grade scale. The related course where the grade is being summed might have a 1-20 numeric grade scale so that up to 5 standard grades can be summed into the course grade for a maximum course grade of 20."",""You do not want to have a separate scale where specific summed standards grades are evaluated against a larger maximum range.""
```

Important Usage Note: In PowerTeacher Pro, you can mark any score as Exempt. If a student was sick during the last quiz, you can exempt this score. The most recent calculation will then ignore that score, and use the previous score. In this manner, you can use the most recent scores, while still exempting any scores that are not good reflections of the student's learning.

How Do I Determine the Standards Final Grade for the Marking Period?

The default calculation method is used as a starting point. However, as described above, sometimes these measures work very well, and other times there are reasons to prefer a different calculation. The default calculation is a good starting point. However, the teacher should review the standards scores above, and review the calculations in the summary area below. Then the teacher can determine if the calculated score is correct for the report card for this student, or if they want to choose a different grade on that standard for that student.

Here are two examples, both of which start with the default calculation of the highest score for the final standards grade.

Student 1

* Scores: 3,3,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4
* Highest = 4
* Final Grade Decision on this standard: For this student, 4 is probably a good choice for the final grade on this standard. No change or further work needed.

Student 2

* Scores: 2,2,4,2,1,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2
* Highest = 4

Final Grade Decision on this standard: For this student, it would be good to know more about the time they got a 4. Likely, the teacher will want to change the standard final score on the report card from 4 to 2. Two is the median, mode, approximate average, and the most recent score. With this data, 2 appears to be a more accurate representation of the student's actual proficiency level on this standard than 4."

"# Graduation Plan District Setup
On this page:

You can create two types of graduation plans: graduation plans and post-secondary preparation plans. Graduation plans define the requirements a student must fulfill to graduate high school. Post-secondary preparation plans define the requirements a student must fulfill to attend a post-secondary institution, such as a state college or university.

If your district has a certain group of students in a graduating class that has different requirements, you can create multiple graduation plans. For example, High School Graduation, PE Waiver/No PE Requirement Plan, or Special Education Plan. Set up plans at the district level so different schools can share graduation plans for students. 

Graduation plans created using the previous version of Graduation Planner can continue to be managed using Historic Graduation Plans. New graduation plans that have an end date later than 2026 should be created using the advanced Graduation Plan feature.

You can promote previously created plans (Historic Graduation Plans) to use the advanced Graduation Plan. Each historic plan must be migrated individually."

1. On the Graduation Plan Setup page, click Reorder in the Course Groups and Credit Types section.
2. Use the up and down arrows to set the order.
3. Click Save.# Add a Test Group Requirement
You can add test groups to a graduation plan to track and evaluate student progress towards graduation requirements based on more complex logical requirements. For example, a student will qualify for a High School Diploma with Academic Achievement if the student completes either the ACT (with a score of 21, no section below a 30) or the SAT (with a score of 1200, neither section below 500). 

Test groups can be layered into hierarchies to compare several conditions using multiple group types. This is achieved in several ways. One way is by creating parent test groups and then adding child test groups to the parents. 

Another method is to create additional test groups, but instead of adding tests to the test group, add a child test only. This allows for situations when two conditions must be met to meet the test group requirement, such as a minimum on a test type score (a test group with an And group type) and an overall exam score (a test group with a Sum group type).

1. Click Add next to the parent or primary requirement, then select Add Test Group Requirement.
2. Enter the Test Group Name, then choose the Requirement Logic for the group:
    * All - All credit minimums must be met to achieve the requirement.
    * Any - At least one of the credit minimums must be met to achieve the requirement. 
    * Sum - A combination of scores must meet a summation total.
3. Choose the Test Score Logic.
    * Best combined scores for all sittings - The system will look at all possible combinations of scores across all tests taken and use the highest combination.
    * Best score from a single sitting - The system will look at all tests taken on a single date and use the best overall score from a single date.
4. Select Allow Waiver to enable the ability to waive graduation requirements for students within this group.

"# Health Plans

On this page:

With more health conditions being tracked and accommodations made for students to attend regular school regardless of the medical condition, school personnel that interacts with a student need to be made aware of the condition, how to recognize warning signs, and how to react in critical conditions. Use the Health Plans tab on the student Health page to select a health plan template and customize it for the student based on their specific needs for the condition. Once a health plan is associated with a student, an alert appears on the student's record indicating to other users that interact with the student. Once a user has read and understood the health plan for the student, a read receipt is logged for that user. The plan continues to display in the alert even after you have read and acknowledged the health plan. The status of the plan in the alert reflects whether it requires acknowledgment. If a health plan is updated, the status of the plan in the alert will indicate the need to re-acknowledge.

"# PowerPack Migration
On this page:

Use Health Plugin Data Migration to migrate the PowerPack Health plugin tables to the Enhanced Health tables. The 11 tables that can be migrated appear on the Health Plugin Data Migration page in the order by which they should be migrated. The table order is important for the first 4 tables due to the inter-dependencies. Nearly all of the migrations depend on Codesets being migrated. Med Inventory and Med Admin depend on Medication and Codesets. If a dependency issue does block migrating necessary data, you can go back to the previous table, address the issue, re-scan, and re-migrate, then rescan and re-migrate the table with the necessary data."
"# The Process
Migration is performed as a multi-step process on each of the tables. The first step is to Scan the table. This step validates the existing data and builds a list of records that will need correction before they can be migrated. Scanning may take a few minutes depending on the number of records. If there are any issues with a record, the record cannot be migrated. The total number of issues, if any, appears as a link in the Issues Found column. The number may not correlate to the number of records, as a single record may have numerous issues. Most issues can be resolved by going back to the PowerPack Health plugin pages and correcting the data. In some cases, it may be necessary to export the affected table, correct the data, and re-import the data. Note that no data must be corrected. All records that have issues will be skipped during migration. It is up to your district to decide whether or not to correct and migrate those records. Once data has been corrected, scan again to confirm that the issues have been resolved. The second step is to Migrate the data. Migrating may take a few minutes depending on the number of records. You can Scan and Migrate a table as many times as needed. Only the data not previously migrated is scanned or migrated. The third step is to Finalize Migration once you are satisfied that all of the necessary data has been migrated. Upon finalizing the migration, the Health Plugin Data Migration tab no longer appears on the Health Setup page.# Migrate PowerPack Health Tables

State/Province Reporting
------------------------

For state/province-specific information, see PowerSchool's recommended state/province-specific setup of Health Management settings available in your state/province reporting setup guide. If there is no state/province-specific setup specified in your state/province reporting setup guide, you do not have PowerSchool state/province-required Immunization reports that are supported at this time. Therefore, no state/province-specific setup considerations need to be taken into account. You may set up Health Management as needed by your district."
"# Import Student Immunizations
Using the Data Import Manager, you can import student immunizations and update existing student immunizations. To import a new file, select Choose File and select a file to import. Then select Health: Student Immunizations for your Import Into option."
"# About Importing Immunizations
The Health: Immunizations section of Data Import Manager allows you to import an immunization dose as well as an exemption to a vaccine. The import will also include associated data such as the immunization itself. To associate more than one child record, multiple related rows are included in the import file. Some fields have rules regarding what is a valid value (dates, booleans, code sets). An invalid value may cause a single row or multi-row import to fail.

Multi-row imports have additional checks for duplicates and conflicting values. Below are rules for duplicates and conflicts for each entity. Duplicates are ignored during the import, while conflicts are rejected with appropriate error messages. When processing multiple related rows, the import process rejects all related rows if any of the rows have an error. Review the error messages for each failed row displayed on Import Results.


To import more than 1 HEALTHSTUDDOSEREC rec for a single vaccine code i 
mport N rows with the same data for HEALTHSTUDIMMREC (no id needed for create or update) and different dose data. 



Review the Vaccine record in the District setup to see how many doses we can import per main immunization record. 

Important to note:

* Import of extensions is not supported although the extension fields are displayed in the Map columns page.
* Since HealthStudImmRecId is not importable, Do Not process record or Update Existing Record is not considered while adding only exemptions for a Vaccine without any dose details. Record gets updated even when Do Not process record is selected. If you try to update a Dose (by dose number) that existed before, you need to select Update Existing Record or you will get an import error for that record. 
* You can import immunization information without dose information if you are exempting a specific vaccine from all doses (ie, religious exemption). 

* Either exemption information or dose information must be included for a particular vaccine record import.

* For performance and reading and writing the data with the legacy API, the import file should be in continuous blocks by studentID."

Behaviors are typically the offenses that occurred. Objects are the items used during the incident. Attributes are details about the incident itself and are not directly related to any participant. The district defines all of these elements.

Certain codes/subcodes may have a policy indicating instructions for working with the codes/subcodes."

"# Incident Management

Use Incident Management to specify and record an entry for school or district-related discipline incidents. These incidents may include from zero to many participants and may include students, teachers, and persons known or unknown, not enrolled or employed by the school district. Incidents may also include from zero to many objects, such as weapons, drugs, vehicles, and any other item that is part of the incident. Actions may also be attached to incidents in a zero to many relationship and describe actions taken as a result of the incident. Objects and actions may be linked to participants as well as the incident itself. For example, a weapon may be linked directly to a person or simply found at the scene. The action of ""increased security"" may be related to an incident of vandalism with no participants, or linked directly to a participant as in suspension for a student who committed an offense.

Creating discipline incidents involves selecting the incident types, codes, subcodes, and secondary incident subcodes, which are created at the district level. This ensures that all schools are using the same data to enter discipline incidents. Search for existing incidents on the Search Using Incident List page, or create a new incident on the Incident Detail page. 

Incident codes allow you to manage specific information by category, subcategory, and incident type. These codes and subcodes appear on the Incident Detail page for those users with assigned page-level security. Security settings determine who can view, create, and edit incidents. For more information, see Edit Security Groups.

Access incident information either by viewing incidents within PowerSchool by performing an ODBC/JDBC query using a third-party application such as Microsoft Excel. Future access through reports is planned and state reporting extracts will use this incident data."

"# Pre-Import Checklist
For a more detailed list of pre-integration items, use the Course Planner PowerSchool SIS Pre-Integration Checklist.

* Identify the Naviance Subject area, the SCED Subject Code, and any subject areas for which you will import courses.
* Create the Subject Areas in Naviance prior to the import.

Note: If you have previously manually imported SCED Subject Areas in Naviance, verify that SCED Subject Areas are stored in the SIS. If they are not, create new subject areas in Naviance that align with the subject areas used in the SIS.

Tip: Review data fields for Courses and use this information when mapping fields.

* Determine if the subject area populates the Department field or the Subject Area field.
* Determine if CTE courses are identified by selecting Vocational Class in the CIP Code field, by noting the course as Career Tech, or by assigning an Alternate Course Number.
* Determine if course descriptions are included in the Course Description field in the SIS or if course descriptions are kept outside of the SIS. Naviance recommends that your SIS is the source of truth; however, if descriptions are kept outside of the SIS, you can import course descriptions manually in Naviance (Data Import).

Tip: If descriptions are not kept in the SIS, do not include the data field in your import. Empty fields in your import file will override previously imported data.

* Determine how you assign instructional level to courses. Is it part of the course number or is it a custom field in your SIS?
* Determine if you assign state ID using the alternate course number field, the course number field, or another field.
* Determine if Prereq Text is included in the Prerequisite Note field.
* Determine if a rule exists for Prereq ID.
* Determine if a Concurrent Request rule exists for Coreq ID.
* Determine if a Recommend rule exists to identify courses that require a
* Determine which field is used to indicate if a course is Repeatable? Allow Student to Repeat Different Term, Allow Student to Repeat Same Term, or a custom field?
* Determine if Equivalencies have been added to the SIS. Import the equivalencies for courses not included in a plan of study.
* Update course data fields in the SIS if no data exists for a field you want to import.# Verify Fields for the SIS Import
* Verify the column fields you are using for your SIS import by identifying the field names and confirming that the data populates correctly.

Log types are used to group log entries by classification indicating the nature of a log entry. Additionally, subtypes can be created within each log type to further characterize the log entry. For example, a log entry related to cheating on a test is discipline-related. Discipline is the log type, and cheating is the subtype.

Only authorized staff members can view, add, edit, and delete log entries and discipline alerts.

"# Custom Student Fields and Screens Setup

Use custom Student Fields and Screens function to display a variety of information about students. PowerSchool supports the addition of up to 999 custom student fields. For example, create a page that includes vehicle-related information that you want to track for each student. First, create the custom fields. Next, create the custom screen. Finally, add the custom fields to the custom screen you create.

The Custom Fields/Screens pages can be accessed via Start > System > Custom Fields/Screens or by Start > System > Page and Data Management > Custom Student Screens.

Note: PowerSchool recommends that when adding custom fields, use the Database Extension and Custom Field Migration features.

2. Click Page and Data Management. 
3. Click Custom Page Setup.
4. Select the Enable Custom Web Page Application checkbox.
5. Click Save. 

Migrate Custom Web Pages
------------------------

After enabling customizations and Custom Web Page Management, you will have the opportunity to migrate your existing custom web pages from the PowerSchool custom webroot directory into the PowerSchool database in order for your customizations to continue working properly. If you do not migrate your existing custom web pages, your customizations will no longer appear in PowerSchool. Only customizations entered using the custom web page application will appear. 
When performing the migration process, a report is generated indicating whether or not the migration was successful and identifies any issues that were encountered during the migration. Using the report, you can reconcile issues and perform the migration again. 
The migration process can be performed as often as needed. Note that file names are not case-sensitive. Therefore, files with the same name will be overwritten. 
Note: If you are using PowerSchool Server Array where the server array is using a share point for the custom directory, PowerSchool must be actively running on the same machine as the Tomcat server hosting the custom pages web application for the migration to run correctly. 



1. On the start page, choose System under Setup in the main menu. 
2. Click Page and Data Management. 
3. Click Custom Page Setup.
4. Verify the Enable Custom Web Page Application checkbox is selected.

* The \*contact\_info DAT is always run from the student's perspective.
* The DAT starts with a list of contacts for each student, ordered based on the priority order than can be seen on the Students Contact page.
* Each contact can have a number of addresses, emails, or phone numbers that are sorted in ascending priority order for each category. These contact items have attributes such as ""Type"" than can be used to filter the list.
* The items in the remaining filtered list are assigned a temporary index for reference within the DAT. For example, when a contact has 2 phones with type ""Home"" and 2 phones with type ""Work"", if the DAT has filtered to only Home phones then then index 2 will reference the second ""Home"" phone even if it started out as the 3rd phone number in the unfiltered list.
* If an expression resolves to nothing, an empty string is returned. For example, a request to display the 3rd Home phone in a list of 2.
* If an expression is not allowed to return a field due to the user's Field Level Security role restrictions, a string of five asterisks is returned (\*\*\*\*\*).
* It is possible for historical and future relationship detail records to exist between a single contact and student. Only one relationship detail record can be active on any given day. The \*contact\_info DAT only considers the relationship detail record that is active on the day the DAT is used.
* If an argument resolves to nothing, such as asking for the (non-existent) step-god father relationship, or an index 10 of a list of 3, nothing (an empty string) is returned.# Syntax

"# Grades and Assessment DATs
This section includes DATs used to return grading and assessment information."
"# Stored Grades
Stored grades data is extracted from the \[StoredGrades\] table using the stored.by.course.number DAT with the course name, store code and field name, or with the stored.by.course.period.cached DAT, using the expression, store code and field name. The stored.by.course.numberlist allows users to return data for multiple courses using one DAT.

Format: ^(stored.by.course.number;coursenumber;storecode;field) – Based on course name. 
Example: ^(stored.by.course.number;ENG2100;S1;grade) 

Format: ^(stored.by.course.numberlist;coursenumber,coursenumber;storecode;field) – Multiple courses in one DAT. 
Example: ^(stored.by.course.numberlist;ENG2100,FRL3200,HIS3199;S1;grade) 

Format: ^(stored.by.course.period.cached;expression;storecode;field) – Based on expression.

```# Standards and Standard Grades Section
The standard (std) DAT extracts standard data from the Standard table, and standard grade data from the StandardGradeSection and StandardGradeRollup tables (and their companion tables StandardCourseAssociation, StandardGradeSectionComment, and StandardGradeRollupComment).

When retrieving standard definition information, the DAT returns data from the Standard record.

When retrieving standard grade information, if the standard has only been assessed in one section for the same reporting term, the grade information will be returned from StandardGradeSection. If the standard has been assessed for more than one section for the same reporting term, the grade information will be returned from StandardGradeRollup.

Note: DATs with “cache” in the code (for example, \*std.storedcache.avg) pull data from the server memory, rather than accessing the database each time the report is rendered. The first call to one of these DATs caches all of the standard grades for a student for a year. Subsequent calls pull the data from memory. This is advantageous when you want to run reports on multiple standards DATs, and results in increased performance of the report.

Format: ^(\*std.stored.high;StandardIdentifier;Store Code;Year;Grade Level) 
Example: ^(\*std.stored.high;SSS.6;S1;2008;12)"
"# Standards
Note: XX = Standard Identifier, TT = Store Code, YYYY = Year, or GG = Grade Level. The YYYY or GG parameter is optional, and if omitted, the DAT will default to the year selected in the Term context and will include all grade levels.

Note: If Type, Term, Grade, Year, Credittype, or Scale are specified in the GPA calculation as setup at the District, the setting at the District will take precedence over the setting as specified in the GPA DAT.

For example, if the Weighted GPA is setup at the District with ENG and MAT specified as Credit Types, the following GPA DAT example will only include grades that are associated with the ENG or MAT credit types, even though credittype is not specified in the DAT:

Decode
------

The Decode expression is used to evaluate a field against one or more specified values and return a result relative to each value.

Basic Format: ^(decode;fieldname;value;return;value;return;else)

```
""Name"",""Code"",""Description""
""Fieldname"",""^(decode;Fieldname^(decode;^(gender)"",""The name of the field to evaluate""
""Value"",""^(decode;Fieldname;Value^(decode;^(gender);M"",""Evaluate the field against the specified value.In this example, the field gender is evaluated against the value M.""
""Return"",""^(decode;Fieldname;Value;Return^(decode;^(gender);M;Male"",""Value to return if the field matches the preceding value.In this example, the value Male is returned if the gender field equals M.""
""Else"",""^(decode;Fieldname;Value;Return;Else)^(decode;^(gender);M;Male;Female)"",""Default value to return if the current field value did not match any of the evaluated values.The value Male is returned if the gender field equals M. Otherwise, the value Female is returned.""
```

Note: All parameters are required when using the decode DAT. Value and Return can be repeated to evaluate a field for multiple values.

Example #1: ^(decode;^(gender);M;Male;Female)

The value Male is returned if the gender field equals M. Otherwise, the value Female is returned.

Example #2: ^(decode;^(gender);M;Male;F;Female;Not Specified)

The value Male is returned if the gender field equals M. The value Female is returned if the gender field equals F. The value Not Specified is returned if the gender field does not equal M or F."

"# Data Access Tags

Introduction
------------

As a PowerSchool user, you search for data on a daily basis. Your searching involves simple search comments, detailed compound searches, and complex search codes. But once you find the data, how do you get it into a report or another usable format? Use PowerSchool codes to add PowerSchool data to object reports, report cards, mailing labels, form letters, and more. PowerSchool data codes are used to retrieve information from the PowerSchool database. PowerSchool will retrieve the data from the fields that you specify for the selected student or group, and inserts that data into your report, letter, or other document type. Data access tags, or DATs, are a special variety of PowerSchool codes that retrieve information from one or more PowerSchool database tables. Many DATs have a special naming convention along with specific rules on how to use the DAT.

Data Access Tag Usage
---------------------

DATs will function in the following report types:

* Form Letter
* Mailing Labels
* Object Report: Text Object
* Report Card Header
* Report Card Footer

Note that some DATs will also function in the following reports and PowerSchool pages:

* List Students Group Function - usually used with student information DATs.
* Quick Export – usually used with student information DATs.
* GPA Student Screens page – usually used with GPA and Credit DATs.
* AutoSend"

"# PowerQuery DATs
The PowerQuery DAT leverage specially crafted PowerQueries that allow for Core, State Reporting, and Customer created PowerQueries to be used in Reports and some Export functions. Access to PowerQueries, and their data, are linked to Page Permissions. Users must have at least Read Only access to the Page listed under the Portal - Page section of the table below for the PowerQuery DAT to return results. 

For PowerSchool SIS Technical Contacts who would like to learn more about creating your own PowerQueries for use in the PowerQuery DAT please reference the PowerQuery DAT section of the Developer Site.

"# School Counselor DATs

Introduction
============

This page describes the behavior of the schoolcounselors DAT. 

Given
=====

* Lists all counselors available at a school

* If no counselors are available at a school, an empty string is returned.


Important Notes
===============

* The \*schoolcounselors DAT is always run from the student’s perspective.

* Without the “all” parameter provided, the tag returns only counselors available at the school of the current student.

* The DAT sorts counselors by first and last name. If the “all” parameter is specified, the sort is by school, then first/last name.


Syntax
======

```
""Arguments"",""Separated by semicolon""
""form on WEB page"",""~(*schoolcounselors[;...])""
""form on Object Report"",""^(*schoolcounselors[;...]) or ~(*schoolcounselors[;...])""
""form in Quick Export"",""^(*schoolcounselors[;...]) or ~(*schoolcounselors[;...])""
""from Student Fields:"",""*schoolcounselors[;...]""
```

Default (No Args Form)
======================

```
""What"",""Returns the list of counselors available at the student's school.""
""Example"",""~(*schoolcounselors)""
```

Parameters
==========

The schoolcounselors DAT allows for four parameters. Each separator parameter has three possible special values, in addition to any text otherwise provided.

* newline - specifying this as a separator forces the separator to be a new line on the output

* indent \- specifying this as a separator forces the separator to be an indentation (four space characters) on the output

* newline-indent - specifying this as a separator forces the separator to be a new line followed by an indention on the output


```
""Parameter"",""Description""
""First param:All"",""""""all"""" - Providing the """"all"""" value will display all counselors at all schools, not only the student’s school. The counselors are sorted by school, then by first/last name. By default, they are formatted with the school name on a new line, followed by a list of comma separated counselors indented on the next line. Example: ~(*schoolcounselors;all)Result: Milan High School John Counselor, Jane Counselor Venice High School Denise Counselor Arrezzo High School John Counselor, Paul Counselor, George Counselor""
""Second param:counselor separator"",""When specified, this param will be the text used to separate counselors within a single schoolExample: ~(*schoolcounselors;;||)Result:John Counselor *Primary||Jane CounselorExample: ~(*schoolcounselors;;newline)Result:John Counselor *Primary Jane Counselor""

"# Manage Text Mask Sets

On this page:

Using the Text Mask Administration page, you can define your own patterns of letters, numbers, and other characters as user-defined text masks. Fields that have text masks associated to them are validated upon submitting a page that contains those fields. If an error occurs, a field level message appears indicating the correct format to be used, such as (###) ###-####.

Text mask sets may also be used to validate field entry against a specific series of values, such M and F for validating data entry of gender.

6. Enter the allowed text mask formats, which will be used in error messaging, such as (###) ###-####.
7. Enter the text mask format, such as (###) ###-####. The text mask format can be made up of a series of character placeholders, including:

    * \# - Number placeholder
    * @ - Alpha placeholder (any non-number)
    * \* - Any number of any character
    * \\ - Escape character (to allow for use of placeholder characters as literals)
    * Use any other literal character as a delimiter.

    To add another Format/Value, click the Add Row (+) icon. For example, if adding acceptable formats for Phone Number, you may want to also add ###-###-####.

"# Data Validation
On this page:

PowerSchool now provides data validation to promote data integrity by preventing invalid data from being entered or imported into PowerSchool. Data validation is automatically enabled and appears throughout PowerSchool for certain Students and Teachers fields. For a detailed list of fields, see the Appendix.

Localized versions of PowerSchool support data validation. All dates, numbers, text, and messaging appear in the localized format and all data is validated against applicable rules.

Note: State-specific pages are currently not validated using this new validation capability. Validation of state-specific pages will be implemented in a future version and deployed on a state-by-state basis."

"# Work with Data Validation

On this page:

AutoComm
--------

When data is imported into the Students or Teachers table using the AutoComm function, it is validated against applicable data validation rules. When the AutoComm function runs, the system emails the recipient the status of the AutoComm process if an email address is specified in the E-Mail completion report to field. Successful AutoComm runs can contain up to 100 Error messages for records that failed to import due to validation issues. Unsuccessfully imported records are not updated during the AutoComm import. If a record was not imported due to a data validation error, the message ""Error on line \[#\]: Validation error for field: \[field name\]"" appears along with one or more of the following explanations:

* * Empty value is not allowed
    * Value may not contain more than \[#\] character(s)
    * Value must be a number
    * Value must be a valid date
    * Value must be an integer
    * Value must be at least \[#\]
    * Value must be less than or equal to \[#\]
    * Value must be on or after \[date\]
    * Value must be on or before \[date\]
    * Value must contain at least \[#\] character(s)

Note: If a record was unsuccessfully imported due to a data validation, the system does not attempt routine validation until the data validation is corrected.

For the import status on unsuccessful records, see the system log. Review the details about each error, make any necessary corrections, and then run the AutoComm function again. Continue this process until all files are imported.

Page Submission
---------------

Fields that have data validation rules associated to them are validated against those rules upon submitting a page that contains those fields. Upon submitting a page, the following occurs:

* If there are any data validation errors, a warning message appears at the top of the page indicating that the information could not be saved, each type of error encountered and the number of occurrences of each error, for example:

Information was not submitted. Please see error messages on the page and correct before submitting again. 
Number cannot be less than \[#\] - (X) 
Number must be at least \[#\] digits in length - (Y) 
Date must be on or after \[date\] - (Z) 



Note: Where X, Y and Z are the count of the number of occurrences of that error on the page.

* A message appears next to each field where a data validation error occurred indicating a correction needs to be made. For more information, see Rules by Data Type.
* When updating fields that need to be corrected, the orange warning message that appears at the top of the page scrolls with the user as the user corrects each field.
* When updating fields that need to be corrected, data validation error messages remain until a valid entry is made. For more information, see Rules by Data Type.
* Once all data validation errors are corrected, the orange warning message then appears green indicating that the information is now valid and can be saved.

Quick Import Data
-----------------

Data that is imported into the Students or Teachers table using the Quick Import function is validated against applicable data validation rules. The results page displays both successfully and unsuccessfully imported records. Unsuccessfully imported records are not updated during the import. If a record was not imported due to a data validation error, the message ""Not imported: Validation error for field: \[field name\]"" appears along with one or more of the following explanations:

* Empty value is not allowed
* Value may not contain more than \[#\] character(s)
* Value must be a number
* Value must be a valid date
* Value must be an integer
* Value must be at least \[#\]
* Value must be less than or equal to \[#\]
* Value must be on or after \[date\]
* Value must be on or before \[date\]
* Value must contain at least \[#\] character(s)

Note: If a record was unsuccessfully imported due to a data validation, the system does not attempt routine validation until the data validation is corrected.

Review the details about the error, make any necessary corrections, and then import again. Continue this process until all records are imported."
"# Create Table and Field Extensions
On this page:

Create new and manage existing database extensions from the Page and Data Management page. Coordinate with your district to ensure that migration of custom fields are only processed by one person.

The overall steps for adding a database extension are as follows:

1. Select the functional area of the application to extend, or create an independent table for the extended data.
2. Select a workflow type. You can add fields to the default extension, or create and manage database extensions, tables and fields.
3. Choose a PowerSchool database extension table to modify, or create a new table.
4. Create new fields for the database extension table."
"# Add a Field to a Default Extension
Use the default database extension group and table to easily add a new field. A default extension is available for every table. To create an independent table, see Create a New Independent Table.

11. Enter the default value for the field. By default, a row in the database won't exist until a field is populated. If any other field is present in the table, the row would have been created and then the (example field) would have had the default. The default is done on the Oracle side as part of the table definition. Since a row doesn't exist there won't be a value.
12. Choose a legacy custom field in order to migrate data from the selected field to your database extension field. The default Type is set to String and the default Length is set to 4000 automatically. This option is unavailable if there are no remaining legacy custom fields.

"# Database Extensions

Database extensions allow you to display customized information in PowerSchool. Database extensions replace what was formerly known as custom fields. You can manage your database extensions in PowerSchool. In addition, you will be able to use existing functionality such as import, export, and reporting tools to access database extension data. Database extensions provide an expandable foundation for developing custom page content. 
Database extensions provide the following benefits: 

* Improves the reliability of custom data elements and provides a solution for existing pages and reports.
* Improves application performance when accessing database extension data elements directly.
* Removes the dependency on custom fields and virtual tables, enabling PowerSchool to run in a fully customized manner.

How it Works
------------

Database extensions may be created through the PowerSchool user interface and define the table structure and related fields. There are three basic types of tables defined in a database extension:

* One-to-one table extension
* One-to-many table extension
* Independent table (not linked to a PowerSchool table)

You can use different combinations of these table types:

* Add a one-to-one table extension to a PowerSchool table, a one-to-many table extension, or an independent table. You can only have one table extension on any other table.
* Add a one-to-many table extension to a PowerSchool table, another one-to-many table extension, or an independent table.
* Independent tables do not extend from another table.

Once a table is extended, you can add fields to the table and specify data types as well as migrate remaining user-created legacy custom fields to the extension table. The new table and field extensions are available on the Custom Fields and Screens pages."
"# View Migration History

To view a list of all custom fields sets that have previously been migrated, click Migration History. Each field set that has been migrated appears on the page. When the field set is migrated, it is no longer available to select on the Field Set to Migrate pop-up menu on the Choose Custom Fields Set section of the page."
"# Export Data Using the Data Export Manager

Use the Data Export Manager to export data from PowerSchool tables, database extensions, and PowerSchool data sets into a text file. This function may be performed at the school or district level and may be performed for a student selection or staff selection. 

Information displays based on your security permissions

Only data sources for which you have export access to all required tables and fields will be available for selection. If a data appears shaded and cannot be selected, you do not have field level access to that data.

1. On the start page, choose System in the main menu.
2. Click Page and Data Management. 
3. Click Data Export Manager.
4. In the Select Columns to Export section:
    1. Choose the Category that contains the data you want to export:
        * Tables displays the top 22 PowerSchool tables followed by most other PowerSchool tables.
        * Database Extensions displays database extensions.
        * PowerSchool Data Sets displays approved data sets and any preexisting or new export modules.
        * Additional Data Sets displays all other data sets and third-party PowerQueries.
        * \[Functional Categories\], displays any functional categories within PowerSchool that have display names, such as Attendance, Grading, or Scheduling.
        * \[Uncategorized\] displays any functional categories within PowerSchool that do not have display names.
    2. Choose the data source that contains the data you want to Export From.



    3. Select the columns to export.
    4. Click Next.
5. In the Select/Edit Records section: 

    1. To narrow the list of records by a specific column value, use the Column Filters. If this section does not appear, there are no column filters for the data set. Some fields in your selected data set may not be available for filtering.
    2. It is extremely important to note that you are making a permanent mass-change to data in the database when you use Edit All Filtered Records. Only extensions from the originally selected database extension are editable.

        1. Click Show Records in order for this button to appear.
        2. Click to edit field data for multiple records. 
        3. To narrow the list, enter search criteria in the Filter field.
        4. Select the field option and then enter data.
        5. Click Submit. 
    3. Click Next.



6. In the Export Summary and Options Output section:

    1. Enter Export Format options. 

        When the export is scheduled dynamic file naming:

        * %d = Date in YYYY-MM-DD format. 2016-11-14
        * %t = Time in HR24MI format. 1312
        * %s = CurSchoolID. 100

        For example, c:\\data\\myfile-%d-%t-%s.txt would produce a file called c:\\data\\myfile-2016-11-14-1312-100.txt when executed.

        The default is set to \[selected data source\]\_export.txt.

        Special characters in file names may not display properly depending on your operating system. For example, characters considered reserved by your operating system or file names with leading or trailing periods.

    2. Enter Export Options.
7. Click Export. "

"# Data Export Manager

On this page:

Using the Data Export Manager, you can quickly and easily export data from PowerSchool tables, database extensions, and PowerSchool data sets into a text file.

PowerSchool Tables
------------------

Individual access to most PowerSchool tables is provided through Data Export Manager. Some tables have been removed for security reasons or because they are part of system processes.

Database Extensions
-------------------

Database extensions allow you to display customized information in PowerSchool. Access to one-to-one, one-to-many, and independent database extensions is provide through Data Export Manager. Database extensions may be created through the PowerSchool user interface and define the table structure and related fields.

* Database extension tables are listed in the Export From pop-up menu on the Data Export Manager page using the name of the table.
* Database extension table fields are available in the Data Export Manager when selecting fields to export.
* After choosing a database extension table, the database extension table fields appear in a field list on the left side of the Data Export Manager page. The fields appear in the following order:
    * Each table lists its fields alphabetically after any primary and foreign keys.
    * If the selected database extension table is a 1-to-1 or a 1-to-many extension of a core table, the extension fields appear first, followed by the associated parent table and any of its extensions.
    * If the database extension table is an independent table that does not have a parent table, its fields appear first, followed by any of its extension fields.
    * A child table extension will list its fields and extensions first, followed by its parent table fields and extensions.
* Standard export options are available when exporting from a database extension table.
* Export results for an export from a database extension table are displayed in the downloaded export file.

For more information, see Database Extensions.

PowerSchool Data Sets
---------------------

A PowerSchool data set is a data source that can be accessed via Data Export Manager, as well as the API. A typical PowerSchool data set declares a set of arguments, a set of columns, and a select statement. The arguments are optional, but the columns and select statement are required. A PowerSchool data set is pre-defined by PowerSchool and includes export modules for Course Archive, Incident, Student Email, Transportation, as well as data sets for Students + Courses and others.

Additional Data Sets
--------------------

Additional data sets, also available through Data Export Manager, provide more specific access to data within PowerSchool and are not supported by PowerSchool and provided for convenience only. Additional data sets may be defined by PowerSchool or by a third-party as a PowerQuery, and installed in PowerSchool via the Plugin Package. Once the plugin is installed and enabled, the third-party data set becomes accessible as another resource in PowerSchool.

Notes:

* PowerQueries under the additional data sets section are typically created for a specific function within PowerSchool. In most cases the PowerQueries that are PowerSchool provided are used on specific pages in the SIS UI. As these are typically designed for use within a core PowerSchool page they may not necessarily be designed for use with the Data Export Manager. Consequently, unexpected behaviors may occur when used outside of their primary context.
* PowerQueries may return fields that are calculated and do not exist as a field in the database. For example, the absence or existence of a record in another table or a calculated value.
* PowerQueries may show in light gray (disabled) and not be selectable if the current logged in user does not have appropriate Field Level Security access to all fields the PowerQuery may return. This includes Database Extension fields that Data Export Manager may make available automatically.

Exporting Incidents
-------------------

The participant name fields are designed to export only people who have been created during the incident itself. This field will remain blank for existing students and staff. Participant\_Student\_Number and/or Participant\_Teacher\_Number would be the recommended column selection for existing users if this information is needed.

For example, if a person from outside the district is caught on campus smoking with a senior by a staff member. When writing the incident you would enter the student and staff as normal, but since the person from outside is not in the system but still an offender; they would be created using the option for Create Other. That information there would be what would be placed in the participant fields."

"# Data Import Manager

Using the Data Import Manager, you can quickly and easily import data from a text file into PowerSchool.

Note: Currently data may only be imported into a limited number of pre-defined and Custom Table data sets. Additional data sets will be made available in future releases."
"# Prepare Your Import File
On this page:"
"# General Information
Before importing data, you will need to create an import file. When creating your import file, it is important to note the following:

* Do not use a double quote ("") as the field delimiter.
* The double quote is a reserved character and may only be used to ignore other delimiters.
* Field delimiters are regarded as literals if the field value is surrounded by double-quotes.
* Strings are regarded as literals if surrounded by double-quotes.
* Double quotes that are surrounded by double quotes are regarded as part of the value.
* The order of the fields is critical with many imports. Check online help or the export of the same data to see the proper order of fields.

Example 1

Field delimiter as a literal in the field value:

First Name, Last Name, AddressJohn, Smith, ""123 Anyplace Dr, Ste 100""

Results:

```
""FirstName"",""LastName"",""Address""
""John"",""Smith"",""123 Anyplace Dr, Ste 100""
```

Example 2

Field delimiter as a literal in the field value surrounded by double quotes:

First Name, Last Name, AddressJohn, Smith, """"""123 Anyplace Dr, Ste 100""""""

Results:

```
""FirstName"",""LastName"",""Address""
""John"",""Smith"",""""""123 Anyplace Dr, Ste 100""""""
```

Example 3

Double quotes used to escape a field delimiter:

First Name, Last Name, AddressJohn, Smith, 123 Anyplace Dr"","" Ste 100

Produces the following results:

```
""FirstName"",""LastName"",""Address""
""John"",""Smith"",""123 Anyplace Dr, Ste 100""
```

Example 4

Quote within a field value:

First Name, Last Name, AddressJohn, Smith, 123 Anyplace """"""Dr,"""""" Ste 100

Produces the following results:

```
""FirstName"",""LastName"",""Address""
""John"",""Smith"",""123 Anyplace """"Dr,"""" Ste 100""
```

Example 5

Without the double quotes, the field delimiter is not escaped:

First Name, Last Name, AddressJohn, Smith, 123 Anyplace Dr, Ste 100

Produces the following results:

```
""FirstName"",""LastName"",""Address"",""""
""John"",""Smith"",""123 Anyplace Dr"",""Ste 100""
```# Importing Code Sets

"# Importing Incidents
PowerSchool's Incident Management schema spans several complex tables that would otherwise require multiple separate imports to create a single incident. The incident data set in the Data Import Manager allows administrators to import incident records using a flat file import. The flat-file information is translated behind the scenes to fit the actual tables used for incident records.

A single incident can include multiple attributes, participants, actions, objects, or behaviors. As such, the incident import data set allows these column groups to be repeated in your import file to represent multiple groupings of the above items."
"# Incident Element Hierarchy
Within the incident element hierarchy, elements are categorized as a parent, sibling, or child element. Parent and sibling elements can be listed in any order. Child elements must be listed after a parent element in order for the fields to be valid.

* Custom Tables are listed in the Import Into pop-up menu on the Data Import Manager page using the name of the custom table.
* Custom table fields are available for select data sets in the Data Import Manager when mapping fields from the import file to PowerSchool. 

    * If the custom table is a 1-to-1 child table, administrators must map one of the fields in the import file to the foreign key field in the custom table.
    * If the custom table is a 1-to-many child table, administrators must map one of the fields in the import file to the foreign key field in the custom table when adding child records.
    * When updating existing records in the custom table, administrators must map one of the fields in the import file to the primary key field. The foreign key field is ignored if the primary key field is mapped and present for the record. This means that it is not possible to update a foreign key value.
    * If the custom table is a stand-alone table that does not have a parent table, administrators must map one of the fields in the import file to the primary key field only when attempting to update an existing record.



* When mapping custom table fields, the fields appear in the following order: 

    * If the custom table is a 1-to-1 extension of a core table, after the last core field within the import module, the foreign key to the parent table appears first and then all the other custom table fields appear in alphabetical order.
    * If the custom table is a 1-to-many child extension of a core table, after the core table, the custom child table fields are grouped and appear in alphabetical order. The foreign key to the parent table appears first, the primary key appears second, and then all the other custom table fields appear in alphabetical order.
    * If the custom table is a stand-alone table that does not have a parent table, the primary key appears first and then all the other custom table fields appear in alphabetical order.



* Standard import options are available when importing into a custom table. 

    * Administrators can choose whether or not to exclude the first row if it contains headers.
    * Administrators can choose whether or not to update existing records if a match is found.



* Data being imported into a custom table will be validated based on the data type and other field attributes. Data types include: 

    * Text must be a text value less than or equal to the database field's length property.
    * Integer must be a whole number less than or equal to 19 digits long.
    * Double must be a numeric value with up to one decimal point and be less than or equal 19 digits long.
    * Boolean must be a numeric value of 0 or 1.
    * Date must be a valid m/d/y format where m can be 1-12, d can be 1-31 and y can be two digits (05) or four digits (2005).



* Import results for an import into a custom table are displayed in the Import Results page."

"# Direct Database Export
On this page:

Use DDE to search and match data in most of the internal tables on your PowerSchool server. Depending on your security settings, you may not be able to perform all functions.

PowerSchool data is stored in a relational database of tables. Each table contains many individual fields. When you use DDE, you directly access a table in the relational database. Use PowerSchool's Direct Database Export (DDE) page to create an export file or report that contains records from the tables. Use another application, such as a spreadsheet application, to view or organize the records. Unlike using the Export Using Template page, you can match and export data from two related tables. When you export data from DDE, the system creates an independent export file that you can open or update using any application you want.

For example, assume you want to export all ninth graders and their current grades to a software application to create a pie graph. Use the DDE function to match the records in the student table to the current grades table; then, export both tables of data, open the export file in a spreadsheet application, and create the graph."
"# Select Records for Export - List View
View a list of all records in a selected table or search for specific records in a table. You can also limit the export to records for all schools on your system or just one school.

"# AutoComm Setup
On this page:

Use AutoComm to synchronize the data in PowerSchool with that in another system, such as a mainframe system. To synchronize your data, set up intervals at which PowerSchool automatically imports files of data from the other system.

To use AutoComm, create an AutoComm record where you determine the synchronization parameters for each of the following files:

* Courses
* Teachers
* Sections
* Students
* Student schedules

When importing multiple section records, the sections' expressions as defined by your school are required. An expression is the combination of the periods and days in which the section meets. Though PowerSchool creates internal values for periods and days, you should import the actual values that you want to appear when the system displays expressions. An invalid expression causes an error for that record, which results in the record not being imported."

"# Import Templates
On this page:

If you often import the same fields of data, you can create a template so that you don't have to define the import parameters and field import map every time you perform an import.

For example, if you often import an update from the school nurse with immunization information, create a template that includes the fields and format for immunization-related fields.

Database Extensions and Import Templates

You can specify any database extension fields on the template.

* Delimiters occurring in the data are not escaped (for example, fields are delimited by tabs, but one field contains tabs) and can cause problems when importing. Data can be wrapped with double quotes to lessen the issue, but there is still data (ex. double quote + tab + double quote) that can cause the same problems.
* Boolean values will be case insensitive, ""true/false"" or ""t/f"" or 1/0."

"# Quick Import
Use the Quick Import function to bring a large amount of data into PowerSchool. Before completing this procedure, you must have an ASCII text file that contains the data to import and is preferably delimited by tabs.

Importing PowerSchool test scores is documented in a separate topic. 

Database extension fields appear while mapping fields from an import file to PowerSchool. When importing and mapping these fields, keep the following in mind:

* As import/export reads from and writes to a text file, binary data is not supported.
* PowerSchool assumes a user only imports data that was exported, therefore it also assumes that date formats and any other formats do not need to be error-checked on import. The date format used is mm/dd/yyyy.
* Delimiters occurring in the data are not escaped (for example, fields are delimited by tabs, but one field contains tabs) and can cause problems when importing. Data can be wrapped with double quotes to lessen the issue, but there is still data (ex. double-quote + tab + double quote) that can cause the same problems.
* Boolean values will be case insensitive, ""true/false"" or ""t/f"" or 1/0."

"# Import and Export
Use PowerSchool's import functions to submit large amounts of information into the system. Use the export functions to retrieve large amounts of information from the system. Before importing or exporting, keep the following in mind:"
"# Select a Group
Before you can import or export, you must select a group of students whose records you want to review. For more information, see Student Search.# Importing Enrollment Dates
You can import student information into PowerSchool using Quick Import or AutoComm. When you import a student record that has an enrollment date prior to or ""less than"" the current date, the student record is considered ""historical."" Historical student records are considered inactive students. Therefore, when searching for such students, your search criteria must start with a slash (""/"") to search all student records."
"# Importing Enrollment IDs
# Basics
* If the EnrollmentID column (Students table) or ID column (ReEnrollments table) is not included in the import, PowerSchool retains the existing value (on an update to a Students table record) or generates a new unique value.
* If the EnrollmentID column (Students table) or ID column (ReEnrollments table) is included in the import with data (values), PowerSchool uses the imported value, assuming it is not already in use by another enrollment. If it is in use, an error message indicating such displays.
* If the EnrollmentID column (Students table) or ID column (ReEnrollments table) is included in the import without data (values), PowerSchool generates a new value, even if one already exists. In general, this is not recommended, as existing information may be used for state reporting.
* The Students table allows for updating of records, whereas the ReEnrollments table does not."

* In general, it is recommended to not include the EnrollmentID column when importing into the Students table. When the EnrollmentID column is not included, PowerSchool automatically determines if an EnrollmentID value already exists. If one exists, the value is retained. If one does not exist, a value is generated.
* Only under certain circumstances it is recommended to include the EnrollmentID column when importing into the Students table. For example, if a Student record has been deleted and needs to be restored from a test or backup server, including the EnrollmentID column would restore the EnrollmentID value back to what it was prior to the deletion of the record (unless the EnrollmentID was different on the test or backup server, in which case it is recommended to not include the EnrollmentID and let PowerSchool generate one). Note that this is just one example where it is recommended to include the EnrollmentID column when importing into the Students table.
* Importing an EnrollmentID column that does not contain data (or contains values of zero) causes EnrollmentIDs to be regenerated for all the imported records, regardless of whether or not an Enrollment ID exists for the record. In general, including the EnrollmentID column without values (or with values of zero) is not recommended.
* If importing new students, you do not need to include the EnrollmentID column. PowerSchool generates a value during the import.# ReEnrollments Table
* The ReEnrollments table does not allow for updating of records. Therefore, to ""update"" a record, first export the existing data (including the ID field), delete the existing record and then re-import the record with the updated data. When re-importing, include the ID column with the exported values so that the ID will not be regenerated.
* If the ID is left blank or if the ID column is not included, a new ID is generated. In general, this is not recommended as existing information may be used for state reporting.
* ""Updating"" should be done with caution. It is recommended you perform the update on a test or backup server first prior to performing on a production server.
* If importing new reenrollments, you do not need to include the ID column. PowerSchool generates a value during the import."
"# Student Number Field
The student number field is essential to moving all of the data in PowerSchool. This field matches student data to the correct student with absolute certainty. Each student has only one number, and everything in PowerSchool is linked to this number. Thus, you should include the student\_number field in all documents that you export. You must include the student number in any document that includes data you want to import into PowerSchool. Keep this in mind when exporting, especially if you want to import the data back into PowerSchool after you have worked with it in your spreadsheet application.# Enroll Status Field
The enroll status field indicates a student's current enrollment status, which defines the student's entire basis in school. Enroll status codes include:

* \-2 or less = Inactive (Must be set manually by an administrator)
* \-1 = Pre-registered
* 0 = Active
* 1 = Inactive (Must be set manually by an administrator)
* 2 = Transferred-Out
* 3 = Graduated Students (Students moved to the ""Graduated Students"" school.)
* 4 = Imported as Historical
* 5 or higher = Inactive (Must be set manually by an administrator)

More often than not, the only time you will see this code is if you are working within the database. However, you may encounter the code within the student pages of the application for students with a enroll status other than Active, such as Inactive, Graduated Students, or Imported as Historical. In this case, the code appears at the top of the page. This field is used throughout the application and is a key element in searching or querying students."
"# Field Names
It is important to spell field names correctly. Case sensitivity is unimportant in field names, but spelling must be exactly as noted on the field list. If you omit the underscore, misspell words, or enter a field name that is different from what exists in the field list, PowerSchool cannot find the field and it will not be imported into or exported from the PowerSchool database. If you do not know how a specific field name is written, click View Field List on the PowerSchool start page.# Special Export Codes
Use special export codes to include a student's GPA or other calculated value in your import or export. For more information about data codes, see PowerSchool Data Codes. You will need your username and password to sign in. If you do not have this information, contact your System Administrator."
"# Data Versus Reports
Importing or exporting data is different than importing or exporting report templates. When you import or export data, you move information between a spreadsheet application and your PowerSchool database. When importing or exporting a report template, you are copying report parameters from one PowerSchool system to another PowerSchool system. For more information about importing and exporting report templates, see Alternate Ways to Create Reports and Report Templates.# SIS Views
SIS Views provide quick access to key metrics and not just raw data. These pre-defined SQL queries extract data that can be joined together and filtered to provide customized results. For detailed information, see the Data Dictionary SIS Views available on PowerSource."
"# Localization
"
"# Introduction
PowerSchool provides a toolkit that makes it easy to translate the system into any language. This includes the PowerSchool SIS Teacher portal, ReportWorks, labels on various pages, fields used for Student/Teacher/Staff searches, and configuration items like Attendance codes, course names and grade scale items. Online help for the Administrator/Student/Parent/Substitute/Teacher web pages can also be translated using the toolkit.

To support this, PowerSchool now uses Unicode, allowing you to enter student names with ""ñ"" or other non-English characters. The translation toolkit also makes it possible to repurpose existing fields in PowerSchool by renaming the labels to suit your school or district's unique needs.

Access to localization tools is based on group security permissions, and can be accomplished in a batch process or on a page-by-page basis, allowing you flexibility for your localization workflow. You can localize PowerSchool into different permutations based on the system locales you configure. Custom pages can also be localized, using the PowerSchool Administrator web application in conjunction with the localization batch process in PowerSchool.# Student and Parent Access Translations
PowerSchool includes translation of student and parent web access into many different languages. This does not translate data coming from PowerSchool, but it does provide base translations for many static labels that exist within the PowerSchool Student and Parent portal. If you create a locale in PowerSchool using one of the languages listed, students and parents can select that language from a pop-up menu on the PowerSchool sign in page. The pages display in the selected language. For more information, see Manage System Locales."
"# Localization Administration
Set up locales, numeric and currency formats, and units of measure from the Localization Administration page accessed via District Office page permissions. Once the system locales are configured, you can set group permissions to allow individual users to localize PowerSchool."
"# Manage System Locales
A locale is a combination of a language plus geographic information that allows you to identify specific variations on a language. In PowerSchool, the locale is defined by the selected language and country code. When locales are created, they appear on the Manage System Locales page and are available on the user sign in pages of the PowerSchool SIS Admin portal, the PowerSchool SIS Teacher portal, and the PowerSchool SIS Student and Parent portal (depending on security settings). Selecting a locale displays all translated items in PowerSchool in the specified language for that locale.

PowerSchool SIS Student and Parent portal pages that are already translated into one of the many languages provided by PowerSchool display on the PowerSchool Student and Parent portal sign in page on the Select Language pop-up menu.

Note: The language selected on the PowerSchool SIS Student and Parent portal Account Preferences page determines the language in which alerts and emails will be received. If the language is not selected then emails shall be sent in default language selected by the district.

Note: Although the English locale is the initial default for PowerSchool, once a new locale is created, it overwrites the English locale. Therefore, if you require an English locale in addition to any other locales you create, you must add an English locale. You must be signed in at the District level to add or edit a locale.

1. On the start page, choose System under Setup in the main menu. 
2. Under Data Management, click Page and Data Management.
3. Under Localization, click Manage System Locales. 
4. To add a locale:

    1. Click Add Locale.

Note: Enter the locale name in the language that pertains to the locale. For example, for a French locale, enter Français, for Spanish enter Español.""
        ""Language"",""Select a supported language from the pop-up menu.""
        ""Country"",""Select a supported country from the pop-up menu.Note: The combination of language and country must be unique. Although you may have multiple versions of the same language, you cannot add two of the same language/country combination. For example, you may select English/US and also add English/Canada, but you could not have two versions of English/US in the system.""
        ""Date Format"",""Select a supported date format from the pop-up menu.""
        ""Time Format"",""Select a supported time format from the pop-up menu.""

        ""System Default Locale"",""Select the checkbox to identify this locale as the system default.Processes that are not associated with a user logon use the locale marked as the System Default Locale. All nightly jobs also use the System Default Locale. Only one locale can be designated as the System Default Locale.""
        ```

    3. Click Submit. 
    4. To switch to the locale you added, sign out of PowerSchool and then select the locale from the Select Language pop-up menu on the sign in page and click Sign In.

PowerSchool supports localization of text that appears on the application pages, and information that displays from the database.

On the Localize PowerSchool page, the Text for Translation area displays the default text to be translated, based on the filtering selected. The translation is entered in the Translated Text field.

The functional areas available for translation are based on the District or School sign in. Attendance codes and other specific user defined data are available for translation at the School level. Field names and other text translations are available at the District level.

The Localize PowerSchool page contains three tabs which allows for translation in the following areas of the application:

* Text – Translation of all static text messages and field names.
* Data – Translation of all specific data such as Attendance codes, grade scales, and search expressions.

Individual page translation, which displays the localize page icon on the navigation bar, is enabled on the Locale Independent Settings page. Access to the Localize PowerSchool page and individual page translation is controlled by security group permissions."
"# Localization Rules
When entering translated text, there are certain rules to follow to ensure a more fluent-sounding translation. Review the following rules before you begin the translation process.# HTML
If there are HTML snippets, entities, etc., in the default translation, those must be maintained in the translated text.

```
""For example:""
""> Change Daily Attendance""
""would be translated into pig Latin as:""
""> Angechay Ailyday Attendanceway""
```"
"# Parameter Substitutions
If the default text has constructions of the form {xxx}, you must exactly reproduce them in your translated text. The majority of the time, these will take the form where 'xxx' is a small number (0 or 1).

```
""For example, if you are translating a text like this:""
""Report {0} of {1} reports(s)""
""and you are translating to French, the translation should be:""
""Rapporte {0} de {1} rapporte(s)""
```

If you omit the {xxx} constructions, the page may not display correctly.

```
""Another example:""
""{0}Family""
""would be translated to:""
""{0}Famille""
```

The purpose of these constructions is to instruct the software where to substitute information into the middle of a message; each {xxx} represents where one variable or database field is inserted. The software specifies where the substituted data comes from; the message text specifies where the data is substituted in the message body.# Parentheses
Whenever parentheses are used, there must be an open and close set in order to translate correctly."
"# Space and Empty String Handling
If the translated text string is empty, the translation user interface deletes the translated record from the database. This allows the string to revert to its default value in the user interface. There may be some cases where an actual blank string should be stored, but the system does not currently allow this.

The translation user interface saves translated text with the same beginning/end spacing as the original (default) text.

```
""For example, if the default text is:""
""key2 = \ records""
""should be translated to Spanish as:""
""key2 = \ registros""
```"
"# Localize Text or Data Batch Mode
Localize static text and messages on the Text tabbed page view on the Localize PowerSchool page. Using the Chose functional area pop-up menu, you can localize text for custom pages, PowerSchool SIS Teacher web access, PowerSchool SIS Student and Parent web access, and ReportWorks.

"# Localize PowerTeacher Administrator
PowerTeacher Administrator does not currently have batch and page-level localization enabled. Therefore, translations must be handled outside of PowerSchool. However, it is necessary to update a specific file on the PowerSchool server in order for customized translations to appear correctly in PowerTeacher Administrator.

Once the customized translation of the PowerTeacher Administrator content is complete, you will edit a properties file available on the PowerSchool server, change the name as specified in the following procedure, and place it in the specified folder.# Update the PowerTeacher Administrator Properties File
1. On the PowerSchool server, navigate to \[drive\]:\\Program Files\\PowerSchool\\application\\components\\powerschool-psweb-\[build number\]\\WEB-INF\\classes\\com.
2. Locate the file package.properties within the folder.

"# View OAuth Client Credentials

PowerSchool uses OAuth 2.0 to secure the data exchange features of a plugin. If you have installed a plugin that uses data exchange, PowerSchool auto-generates the plugin's client credentials. The client credentials are required for the external system to retrieve an access token for data exchange. This is sensitive data and should be kept secure to prevent unauthorized access to PowerSchool data.

PowerSchool is capable of sending the client credentials to the external system automatically if the publisher of the plugin has set up the system to handle automatic registration. If a plugin does not support automatic registration, then it will be necessary for you to manually send the client credentials to the publisher before the external system will be able to use the data exchange features.

"# Address Management
Address Management improves efficiency and accuracy in managing your address data, using cutting edge technology through a visual representation of the address and boundary."
"# Address Validation 
Address validation is the process by which an address is authenticated by an external address validation service, Google Maps, which determines if the address is valid based on whether the address can be found in its mapping database and if the address is of address-level accuracy, one to which mail can be delivered, with the exception of post office boxes. If an address is valid, a geocode is associated with the address, and recorded in the student's database record. If the address is not valid, the areas of uncertainty associated with it and/or alternate addresses are identified. Address validation can be performed for a selection of students or interactively for an individual student. Performing address validation for an individual student can be done using the student's Addresses page or the General Demographics page, as well as during the enroll a new student process.# Boundary Validation
Boundary validation is the process by which an address is identified as being inside or outside a given boundary. Boundaries are defined by the PowerSchool administrator for districts of residence and schools and stored in the PowerSchool database. Boundary validation can be performed for a selection of students or interactively for an individual student. Performing boundary validation for an individual student can be done when performing the address validation process using the student's Addresses page or the General Demographics page, as well as during the enroll a new student process. The relationship of a student's address geocode to defined boundaries is indicated as ""in"" bounds or ""out"" of bounds on the interactive Address Validation page."

Do not use a colon or comma as the Field Delimiter. Preferably, use a tab to separate each field in the export file."
"# Import Address Data
When importing address data, you need to create an ASCII text file, preferably tab-delimited. Do not use a colon or comma as the field delimiter. The import spreadsheet must include the following required fields: Student\_Number, First\_Name, Last\_Name, Geocode, and/or Mailing\_Geocode. The following format must be used when entering geocode information: Lat: \[coordinate\], Lng: \[coordinate\]. For example, Lat: 41.3800231, Lng: -111.0229216.# Perform Batch Address Validation
The batch address validation process provides you with the ability to validate and update address information for multiple students all at one time that currently does not have geocodes defined. The batch address validation process may be used to validate either the primary address or the mailing address of the selected students. When validating primary addresses, a geocode is generated and associated with the student's primary address. When validating mailing addresses, a geocode is generated and associated with the student's mailing address. When performing the batch address validation process, a street, city, state, and zip code may be automatically updated if there is only one matching address that is of address-level accuracy. If there is not an address meeting these criteria, a validation exception occurs and the address appears as an exception, providing you with the opportunity to reconcile the discrepancy.

"# Schoolnet

PowerSchool includes a close integration with Schoolnet, which allows authorized PowerSchool users to seamlessly transition from PowerSchool into Schoolnet.

Schoolnet provides a centralized solution for aligning student assessments, curriculum, and instruction where administrators, teachers, and parents are able to view summarized information for schools, classes and students, as well as detailed reporting and analysis. Using these tools can help administrators, teachers, and parents improve school performance and increase student achievement.

When accessing Schoolnet, My Schoolnet is the main landing page, or portal, for logged-in Schoolnet users. It is designed to provide quick, one-click access to Schoolnet components."

"# Assign Roles to Staff for Schoolnet
On this page:

Once Schoolnet single sign-on is configured and enabled, you can then mass assign Schoolnet roles at the staff level for existing PowerSchool users, which allows PowerSchool users to launch Schoolnet from within PowerSchool and PowerTeac her based on their user roles.

To mass assign Schoolnet roles:

1. Generate a tab delimited text file for a selected group of PowerSchool staff members within a specified school or district.
2. Update the tab delimited text file to include the appropriate Schoolnet roles for each PowerSchool staff member. 

    Note: Single school and role can also be assigned per user. This is done by listing the school number followed by a colon followed by the role. For example, 2125 Amy Bailey 3300401 0 3300401:Teacher. In this example, user Amy Bailey is assigned a Schoolnet Teacher role at school 3300401. 

    Note: Multiple schools and roles can also be assigned per user. This is done by listing multiple school number role combinations separated by a semicolon. For example, 2125 Amy Bailey 3300401 0 3300402:Teacher;3300402:Leadership;3300401:Teacher;3300401:Leadership;3300400:Teacher. In this example, user Amy Bailey is assigned a Schoolnet Teacher and Leadership role at school 3300402, a Schoolnet Teacher and Leadership role at school 3300401, and a Schoolnet Teacher role at school 300400. 




3. Import the updated tab delimited text file back into PowerSchool. 

    Notes: 



* * The schoolnetroles field is now available when using Quick Export or Export Using Template with the Teachers table.
    * Mass assigning Schoolnet roles can only be used for updating existing PowerSchool staff members. To import new PowerSchool staff members, contact PowerSchool Technical Support.
    * The import matches PowerSchool staff members by first name and last name. Therefore, it is recommended that PowerSchool staff members' names be unique. Otherwise, only the first record will be imported and any successive staff members with the same name will be rejected.
    * A maximum of 50 Schoolnet roles may be assigned to a PowerSchool staff member. Exceeding 50 Schoolnet roles per PowerSchool staff member may cause the import to fail.
    * For more information about importing and exporting, see the Import and Export User Guide available on PowerSource"

"# PowerLunch

PowerLunch is the lunch management portion of PowerSchool. The system helps you monitor meals sold, including free and reduced lunches, as well as student account balances and transactions. 

PowerLunch is compatible with a wide selection of bar code and magnetic-strip readers. If your school is properly equipped, students can use their lunch IDs to have their accounts automatically debited as they pass through the lunch line. A full array of reports is available, including meal count reports and transaction reports. 


Meal Classifications
--------------------

PowerLunch classifies cafeteria patrons into several categories. This helps schools maintain records on how many meals are sold. PowerLunch meal classifications include two main groups of patrons: students and adults.

Additionally, use the classifications to prepare reports for government funding. It is important to understand each category before you can set up PowerLunch for your school.

Students
--------

Most people that eat lunch at school are students. They are divided into six groups based on the amount each pays for meals:

* Free: These students have qualified for the free lunch program and are not charged for meals. This is based on the financial situation of the students' families.
* Reduced: These students have qualified for a reduced price for meals. This is based on the financial situation of the students' families.
* Full Pay: These students pay the full, standard price for meals.
* Exempt: These students do not pay for their lunch because of special programs set up by the school. Some schools exempt students because they periodically work in the cafeteria in exchange for lunch. Others allow it because the student has participated in another program that benefits the school in some way. If a school does have such a program, students are usually exempt for specific days only. Generally, students are not exempt from paying for lunch every day. If a student is exempt, the government does not subsidize that lunch. It is important to understand that exempt students are not the same as those who receive free lunches. Whether a student receives free lunches or not depends on the family's financial situation. Students who are exempt from paying for lunch are designated as such because they participate in a school program that allows for it. If a student is exempt, the government does not subsidize that lunch, whereas a free lunch is subsidized.
* Free-Direct Certification: These students are certified by the state and Local Education Agencies for eligibility in the Free School Lunch Program.
* Temporary: These students visit the school and receive lunch there.

Adults
------

While most meals are served to students, some are served to adults. There are three classifications for adult patrons:

* Staff: Staff work at the school or in the school district. Staff members include teachers, administrators, counselors, custodial staff, and maintenance workers.
* Guest: These adult patrons do not work at the school. Visitors such as parents and on-site PowerSchool trainers are guests.
* Earned: These adults have earned a free meal by working at the school. Some schools offer this type of program to those who work in the cafeteria or other part of the school. This classification is the equivalent of the exempt status for students."
"# Work with Plugin Links

Once a plugin is set up, users can launch the plugin from within PowerSchool while keeping their PowerSchool session active allowing them to work in both applications simultaneously.

Note: The link only appears if the link is defined in the plugin configuration file, the plugin is enabled, the link is set to display for the selected school, and if you belong to a user access role that has the capability associated to the link.

Note: If SAML single sign-on settings have been added to PowerSchool as part of the plugin installation, SAML single sign-on links will only appear in the PowerSchool SIS Admin portal and the PowerSchool SIS Teacher portal if: A user is of the user type the link is specified for, and there are no permissions declared in that plugin; There are permissions declared in that plugin, and one or more of the permissions declared in that plugin is turned on for one or more of the user access roles that are assigned to that user."
"# Free and Reduced Lunches
On this page:

Once PowerLunch Initialization setup is complete, you can then begin setting up PowerLunch to serve free and reduced lunches. The first two procedures, Set Eligibility Levels and Create Eligibility Letter Templates, must be done before you can start using PowerLunch. This may or may not be the responsibility of your PowerSchool administrator. School administrators should see Evaluate an Application for information about evaluating applications every time they receive an application for free or reduced lunches."
"# Set Eligibility Levels
For students to receive free or reduced-price lunches, you must set the cut-off amounts for each type of lunch. Additionally, you must set how much money a family can earn to be eligible for each type of lunch. The number of people in a household is also a part of the calculation. The state issues the values for these cut-offs that you enter into PowerLunch.

Repeat this procedure for each household size indicated by your state's directives.

1. On the start page, choose PowerLunch under Applications in the main menu. 
2. Click Meal Program Eligibility under Management.
3. Click Set Eligibility Levels. 
4. Click New. 
5. Use the following table to enter information in the fields:

    ```
    ""Field"",""Description""
    ""Household Size"",""Enter the number of household members identified for this meal program.""
    ""Max monthly income that qualifies for Free meals for this household size"",""Enter the maximum monthly income that qualifies a student for free meals for the specified household size.""
    ""Max monthly income that qualifies for Reduced meals for this household size"",""Enter the maximum monthly income that qualifies a student for reduced meals for the specified household size.""
    ```

6. Click Submit.# Create Eligibility Letter Templates
When a student applies for a free or reduced lunch, you must inform the parents or guardians of the results of the evaluation. To do this, PowerLunch generates letters. Generating such a letter is discussed in Evaluate an Application, but the following instructions explain how to set up the template for the letter.

To evaluate an application for free or reduced lunches, see Evaluate an Application. For more information about serving meals, see Daily Activities.

1. On the start page, choose PowerLunch under Applications in the main menu. 
2. Click Meal Program Eligibility under Management. 
3. Click Free. 
4. Enter text for the letter to appear when a student is approved as free. In addition to standard text, you can include HTML tags and PowerSchool data codes.
5. Click Submit. 
6. Repeat these steps for the other two types of letters: Reduced Lunches and Not Eligible. 
    Note: To make your work quicker, copy the text and codes from the Free Lunch letter, and paste them into body of the remaining letters. Then simply edit the text or codes to make them fit in the new letters."
"# Evaluate an Application
Evaluate a student's application for free or reduced lunches. The default status for all students is Full Pay. An evaluation resulting in free or reduced lunches changes the status accordingly, and PowerLunch records the free or reduced lunch price in the appropriate student record. When the student passes through the lunch line, either the amount for a reduced lunch is charged to the student's account or there is no charge if the student receives free lunches. All lunches (full pay, reduced, free, and earned) are recorded for reporting purposes.

1. On the start page, choose PowerLunch under Applications in the main menu.
2. Click Meal Program Eligibility under Management. 
3. Enter the last names of the students to be evaluated. Separate multiple names with semicolons.
4. Enter the application number, if applicable.
5. Click Submit. 
6. Use the following table to enter information in the fields:

    ""Options"",""Select the standard evaluation option if you just want to verify a student's eligibility. Select the direct certification option to qualify the student by overriding the minimum monthly income requirements.""
    ```

7. Click Submit."
"# Lunch ID Numbers

Once PowerLunch Initialization and Free and Reduced Lunches setup is complete, you can then publish lunch ID numbers.

Publish Lunch ID Numbers
------------------------

Once you assign lunch ID numbers, you must tell each person what their number is. A popular method of doing this is to create mailing labels with the lunch ID and barcode printed on them. Some schools put the label on a card and laminate it. For more information about creating mailing labels, see Mailing Labels."
"# PowerLunch Setup

At most schools, the PowerSchool administrator sets up PowerLunch with the input of cafeteria staff. If you are responsible for setting up PowerLunch, follow the instructions in the sections PowerLunch Initialization and Free and Reduced Lunches. When the setup is complete, proceed to the section Lunch ID Numbers."

Assign numbers to a group of students or to an individual student. Lunch ID numbers may or may not be the same numbers as the student ID numbers. They are linked to the price that students pay for their meals and are used to keep track of students' meal account balances. PowerSchool administrators can assign lunch IDs at some schools.

1. On the start page, search for and select a group of students.

    ```

5. Click Submit."
"# Lunch ID Numbers for Staff
To assign lunch IDs to staff, you must assign them one at a time by going through the Staff page: select the teacher, click Edit Information, enter the lunch ID, and click Submit. This works well for an individual teacher, but sometimes you want to export a list of several teachers, such as during the PowerSchool setup. When you export the staff list to your spreadsheet application, it will be easier to assign lunch ID numbers to each teacher and import that list back into PowerSchool.# Set Up Beginning Student Balances
Once everything else is set up and everyone has a lunch ID, you can start collecting lunch money. Most schools that use PowerSchool allow students to deposit money into their accounts so that they do not have to pay cash every day. This is advantageous for the schools because there are minimal cash transactions. The following instructions explain how to enter the first deposit into an individual student's account and subsequent deposits outside of those occurring as students pass through the lunch line. For instructions on how to handle deposits at the lunch line, see Daily Activities and Maintenance Activities. 

Note: If you are setting up PowerLunch or if you are entering the beginning balance for several students, you can enter the data in a spreadsheet application and import it to PowerSchool. Contact your PowerSchool administrator for more information.

Repeat this procedure for all students when they make their initial deposit into their meal accounts and subsequent deposits that do not occur while passing through the lunch line.

1. On the start page, search for and select a student. 
2. Choose Lunch Transactions under Administration in the student pages menu. 
3. Click New.
4. Use the following table to enter information in the fields:

    ```
    ""Field"",""Description""
    ""Transaction Date"",""Enter the date of the transaction.""

    ""Cash Transaction"",""Select the checkbox if the transaction is a cash transaction.""
    ```

5. Click Submit. 
    Note: Click Lunch Transactions to display the transaction."
"# Set Up Beginning Staff Balances
Enter the first deposit into an individual staff member's account and subsequent deposits outside of those occurring as they pass through the lunch line.

Note: If you are setting up PowerLunch or if you are entering the beginning balance for several staff members, you can enter the data in a spreadsheet application and import it to PowerSchool. Contact your PowerSchool administrator for more information.

1. On the start page, search for and select a staff member.

Totals for multiple days appear at the bottom of each column.# Run the Meal Count Report
This report provides a quick list of total meals served on the selected days. It displays the breakdown by meal and lunch status. The following rules apply to students on this report:

* The guest or earned meal must have been served at the current school in order to be included in the guest or earned meal count for the current school.
* A meal served at the current school for a student enrolled in another school in the district is included in the Meal counts for the current school but excluded from the Eligibility counts.
* The student must be enrolled at the current school (or within the district if running at the district level) on the eligibility count date. The eligibility section of the report only applies to the end date of the date range; students need to be enrolled on that date to be counted correctly on the report.

Note: Once the PowerSchool end-of-year process is complete, no historical meal counts or eligibility counts can be reported for the preceding year.

You can run this report at the district level. If doing so, you must first switch schools to the district office. See 2021-06-25\_19-51-59\_Choose School. Also, the students must be enrolled somewhere within the district during the specified date range.

5. Make sure that the Active Build checkbox is selected.
6. Enter comments in the Build Description field to describe this scenario. If you build a master schedule using another scenario, comments make it easy to differentiate between the two. 
    Note: You can also use this field to denote changes as the build process progresses. 

7. Click Submit to save any changes."
"# Build Validation

Use the results log to identify any errors in your data. Items in the log can be of three types: information, warnings, and errors. All errors must be corrected before you begin building the master schedule. Though warnings do not need to be corrected, you may want to review them before building the master schedule. 
When you start the validate process, the system checks the following types of data: 

* Courses
* Students
* Blocks
* Constraints
* Parameters
* Teachers

The following table displays examples of error messages contained in the validation log:

```
""Validation type"",""Error messages""
""Course"",""Course has been dropped. Missing from course rank. Sections offered is zero.Invalid minimum periods-per-day.Invalid frequency.Invalid maximum days-per-cycle.Invalid term length.Invalid schedule type.Dropped course still listed in course rank.Course is not flagged to be scheduled.The assigned course number is not valid.Requested course number is not a valid course flagged for scheduling.""
""Blocks"",""Invalid block -courses can only be blocked in pairs (no chaining).Invalid block - a course cannot have multiple blocking relationships.""
""Teachers"",""Teacher is flagged for scheduling but has no teacher assignments.Teacher has more periods assigned than periods available.Teacher's max-in-a-row is zero.Scheduled teacher has no scheduled assignments.Invalid teacher.Too many sections assigned to teachers.Not enough sections assigned to teachers.""
""Students"",""Scheduled student has no scheduled requests.Student with requests is not flagged for scheduling.Student is not flagged for scheduling but has requests.""
```

Once you know where the errors in your data are, go back and correct them. For example, if the sign indicates that too many sections are assigned to a teacher, find the related course number and make the necessary changes. Then, validate your scenario until it is error-free."
"# Load Validation

Validate the data in your schedule before loading. This process finds any errors that would prevent the system from loading a master schedule.

Note: The Import link does not appear on the Load Student Schedules Queue page if only validation was performed.

Validate Load Data
------------------

Before running a load, you should validate the data. The validation process finds any errors in your data and alerts you to potential problems.

1. On the start page, choose PowerScheduler under Applications in the main menu. 
2. Under Processing, choose Load from the PowerScheduler menu. 
3. Select the Validate only checkbox.
4. Click Submit. The engine starts to run. For more information, see Understand the PowerSchool Scheduler Page.
5. Under Processing, choose (Q) next to Load from the PowerScheduler menu.
6. Click View in the Results Log column of the appropriate load. 
7. Make the necessary corrections and continue to validate your data until it is error-free."
"# Build Master Schedule Introduction

After you define all of the parameters and constraints outlined in the section Prepare to Build the Master Schedule, proceed by building the master schedule. When you build the master schedule, do the following:

* Validate the data you entered. For more information, see Validate Build Scenarios.
* Begin the build. For more information, see Build the Master Schedule Overview.
* Fix any issues the system finds when building the schedule. If the system stops the build, see When the System Stops the Build.
* Optimize the built schedule.
* Load students into the master schedule.
* Commit the master schedule for the next school year.

You can follow these steps several times to create the best possible master schedule. For example, you might build the schedule and realize you need to add some course sections. After adding the sections, rebuild the schedule. Then, you may find that you need to define a Teacher Part-time constraint, which restricts when the system can schedule a course to which a particular teacher is assigned. Add the constraint and build the schedule again.

You will most likely build the master schedule several times before committing it for the next school year. To ensure that your student schedules are complete, see Checklist to Know Your Student Schedules are Complete.

Complete the appropriate steps in Prepare to Build the Master Schedule before proceeding. There are five main steps you must complete in the following order when building the master schedule:

* Validate Build Scenarios
* Build the Master Schedule
* Load Constraints
* Load Students
* Commit the Master Schedule"
"# Validate Build Scenarios

Before PowerScheduler builds your master schedule, you must validate the information that was entered. The validation process finds any errors in your data, such as too many sections assigned to a teacher. 
The system checks the following: 

* All courses selected as scheduled must be in the rank.
* All courses assigned to teachers must be in the rank.
* Each course has a room that will handle its capacity.
* Student course requests have been dropped if a course is not scheduled.

The validation process also alerts you to potential problems, such as students with no scheduled course requests or a teacher who has more periods assigned than periods available.

Before validating your build scenario, confirm that the build parameters are correct. For more information, see Build Scenario Parameters.

Validate a Scenario
-------------------

1. On the start page, choose PowerScheduler under Applications in the main menu.
2. Under Processing, choose Build from the PowerScheduler menu. 
3. Select the Validate only checkbox.
4. Click Submit. The engine starts to run. For more information, see Understand the PowerSchool Scheduler Page.
5. Make the necessary corrections using the steps described in the section Build Validation. Continue to validate your data until it is error-free."
"# Analyze the Built Master Schedule

After the system completes the build, evaluate the master schedule to see if you need to either make changes and rebuild the schedule or manually adjust it.

To analyze the completed master schedule:

* Print the master schedule.
* Print post-scheduling reports. For more information, see Build the Master Schedule Reports.

To evaluate the master schedule:

* Use the student numbers to evaluate how the system balanced students among sections.
* Evaluate how and when a room is used.
* Be sure teachers are not over- or under-scheduled. Teachers should not be over-scheduled unless you entered an excess number of teacher assignments."
"# Build the Master Schedule
On this page:

After you prepare the master schedule, validate the build scenario you want to use, build the master schedule, and then optimize the master schedule. For information about data validation, see Validate Build Scenarios. For information about optimization, see Optimize the Master Schedule.

Note: It is recommended that you do not use Safari when building your master schedule.

1. On the start page, choose PowerScheduler under Applications in the main menu. 
2. Under Processing, choose Build from the PowerScheduler menu. 
3. Select the Build master schedule option.
4. Select the Use locked master records checkbox if you are rebuilding the schedule after fixing an issue with a particular item, such as a course, room, or teacher, or if you manually entered any sections using the Sections link on the PowerScheduler menu. The system restarts the build at the course it was scheduling when the build stopped, leaving where they were originally scheduled all of the courses it had scheduled before the build stopped. For more information about locked course sections, see Unlock Previously Scheduled Courses. 
    Note: Do not select the checkbox if you are building the master schedule for the first time or optimizing a completed master schedule. 

5. Click Execute. The engine starts to run and the PowerSchool Scheduler page appears. See Understand the PowerSchool Scheduler Page.
6. Click (Q) next to Build on the PowerScheduler menu to view the results of the build.

    ```

8. Click Submit to save your changes if you entered a comment or selected the Delete checkbox."
"# Understand the PowerSchool Scheduler Page
After you click Execute on the Build Schedule page, PowerSchool prepares the information and notifies the scheduling engine on your computer that it is ready to begin the build process. The engine downloads the files necessary for the build and begins to build the schedule.

Note: With Internet Explorer, you can add a File Helper for the PowerScheduler engine application so that you're not prompted to save the engine each time you build. However, if you then work outside the network on which your PowerSchool server resides, you must change the IP address for the engine by modifying the Preferences in the engine application.

It is normal for the engine to immediately quit. The first build attempts cause the engine to do more validation. To proceed, you must eliminate all validation errors. For more information, see Build Results Log.

Once all of the engine validations are eliminated, the engine begins scheduling each course in the course catalog in the order defined in the course rank. The build process can take a long time. You may want to monitor the system's progress to troubleshoot if the build stops.

For each course, the system displays the following:

* Course number
* Course name
* Number of sections
* Number of courses that have been successfully scheduled
* Percentage of courses that have been successfully scheduled

The PowerSchool Scheduler page contains the following buttons:

* More Information: Select this option to view additional information about the course the engine is scheduling. Click Faster Scheduling to viewing less information so that the engine runs faster.
* Stop: Click this button to stop the build. Then, click Yes when asked if you are sure you want to stop scheduling. The system saves the schedule it created before you click Stop, but does not schedule the course it is currently reviewing. For example, you start the build process on Friday afternoon but want to stop the build before you leave for the weekend. On Monday, restart the build where the system left off on Friday afternoon. For more information, see Restart the Build.
* Skip: Click this button to force the system to move on to schedule the next course. You should wait until at least 10% of the combinations are tried before skipping the course. Then, click Yes when asked if you are sure you want to skip this course. You may want to click Skip if the system has tested one million of more than two million combinations for a course and is beginning to slow while attempting the final million combinations. The system then schedules the course in the best combination it has already attempted.

While the engine runs, you may notice that it sometimes slows down. This is because with thousands of scheduling possibilities, the engine must cycle through them to produce the most optimal schedule possible while taking into account student requests, courses, and the constraints upon them. The engine must sort through more and more information as it proceeds with the building or loading process. For example, when the process first begins, it is easy to find a section for a student's request; however, as more sections fill up and fewer sections are available, the engine must work through a student's schedule to attempt to fulfill all course requests. Thus, you may notice periodic slow points as the engine proceeds.# When the System Stops the Build
PowerScheduler may stop the build process for one of several reasons, including the following:

* The engine has encountered validation errors. View the build results log.
* The system has encountered a course for which it cannot schedule all of its sections due to constraints that cannot be respected, data entry mistakes, or some other problem. View the build log.
* The build process is complete.

If the system stops immediately, the PowerSchool Scheduler page displays the following message: ""No longer listening for incoming connections."" This means that your data has uncorrected validation errors. Use the build log to correct these errors. For more information, see Build Log."
"# Build Results Log
To see the results of the build or if the engine stops immediately after starting, check the build results log. This log displays any new validation errors the engine discovered.# View the Build Results Log
1. On the start page, choose PowerScheduler under Applications in the main menu. 
2. Under Processing, choose (Q) next to Build from the PowerScheduler menu.

* Info: These messages are informational, such as ""Course \[x\]: Rescheduled \[x\] students out of \[x\] (leaving \[x\] unscheduled)."" These do not prevent a successful build.
* Warning: These are ""red flag"" messages, such as ""The teacher's preferred room is not suitable for the course the teacher is teaching."" These do not prevent a successful build.
* Error: These messages are validation errors that must be corrected in order for the engine to run, such as ""Invalid valid term found in the Course file (does not match the term length)."" These do prevent a successful build.

2. Under Processing, choose (Q) next to Build from the PowerScheduler menu. 
3. Click View in the Build Log column of the appropriate build."
"# Interpret the Build Log
If PowerScheduler completes the build, the build log displays a quick summary of the build. If the build stops because of a problem scheduling a course, the build log displays details about the course for which it stopped the build. Determine how to resolve the issue based on the following information the system lists for the course:

* Summary of the course parameters, such as whether facilities are needed
* Rooms in which the system already scheduled the course
* Names of teachers assigned to teach the course and their parameters, such as max-in-a-row
* Availability of the required facilities and rooms
* List of possible reasons for stopping

Once you have this information, make adjustments to eliminate or work around the problem. The system will not schedule any additional courses until you correct the issues.# Import the Master Schedule
Each time you build a schedule, you must import the results of that build unless you want to rebuild from scratch. Importing the master schedule flags the sections as locked. If you rebuild from this point forward, you must select the ""Use locked master records?"" option when building. For more information about locked course sections, see Unlock Previously Scheduled Courses.

If the engine stops the build before all courses have been scheduled, you can import the master schedule to view the schedule information in PowerSchool.

1. On the start page, choose PowerScheduler under Applications in the main menu. 
2. Under Processing, choose (Q) next to Build from the PowerScheduler menu. 
3. Click Import. 
4. Use the following table to enter information in the fields:

    ```
    ""Field"",""Description""
    ""Master Schedule?"",""Select this option to import the master schedule without student schedules.""
    ""Master Schedule with Student Schedules?"",""Select this option to import the master schedule with student schedules.""
    ```

5. Click Submit."
"# Review Course Rank
Before you restart the build, you may need to rebuild or update your course rank if you made significant changes to a course or to student course requests.

PowerScheduler uses the course rank to determine the order in which it schedules each course. If you make changes to a course or student course requests, those changes may affect when the system should schedule the course during the build process.

Update the course rank if you add a new course to the course catalog. When you update the rank, the system fits the new course into the rank without moving or recalculating the rank of all the other courses. Rebuild the course rank for all courses if you add or drop sections from a course. The system deletes the previous course rank file and recalculates the rank for every course. For more information, see Build Course Rank.

If you rebuild the rank, do not lock previously scheduled courses when you build the schedule again. Rebuilding the rank places all courses, including those that were scheduled during the last build, in a new scheduling order. To allow the system to create the most successful schedule with the new rank order, build the schedule again by deselecting the ""Use locked master records?"" checkbox on the Build Master Schedule (Step 2) page.# Restart the Build
If you made significant changes to a course or student course requests, review your course rank before restarting the build. For more information, see Review Course Rank. After you solve all issues with the course, click Build on the Scheduling page to build the schedule again. 
When you restart the build, you can do one of the following: 

* Build the schedule again from scratch, which overwrites any courses that the system scheduled before the last build stopped. For more information, see Restart the Build from Scratch.
* Restart the build and lock all or specific courses the system successfully scheduled during the previous build. The system reschedules only courses you do not lock. To unlock sections of courses, see Unlock Previously Scheduled Courses.

After completing one of the above steps, analyze the build to determine if you need to adjust it. For more information, see Analyze the Built Master Schedule."
"# Restart the Build From Scratch
You may want to rebuild the schedule from scratch if either of the following are true:

* Adjustments you made to the course impact courses that were successfully scheduled during the previous build before it stopped.
* You rebuilt the entire course rank file.

For example, if you corrected a teacher conflict by defining a Teacher Part-Time constraint, the correction is likely to affect any other courses that the teacher was previously scheduled to instruct. Therefore, PowerScheduler must reschedule those courses, too.# Unlock Previously Scheduled Courses
When you rebuild the schedule, PowerScheduler automatically selects the Locked Section checkbox on the Edit Section page to lock sections that were successfully scheduled in the previous build. The purpose of locking sections is to save time when rebuilding the master schedule.

Unlock all sections for a course when you want to rebuild that course in the master schedule. The sections are locked as the build runs successfully. If the build partially finishes and then you later rebuild, the system starts where it left off. To have the system rebuild sections of a certain course and then jump to where it left off, you must unlock the sections of the course and select the Use Locked Master Records checkbox when rebuilding. For example, unlock sections of a Biology course. When rebuilding, select the Use Locked Master Records checkbox. The system starts rebuilding with Biology and then skips to where it left off in the previous build.

If you do not select the Use Locked Master Records checkbox when rebuilding the master schedule, the system rebuilds all sections, locked or not. For more information, see Build the Master Schedule."

"# Build the Master Schedule Overview

When building a master schedule, the goal is to satisfy the most student course requests possible while maintaining a good balance of students in course sections. PowerScheduler assigns each section to a period and schedules the sections into classrooms based on the teacher assignments. The system attempts to satisfy as many student course requests as possible, while respecting constraints and the course rank. Before you can build the master schedule, you must download and install the scheduling engine.

Plan to build the master schedule several times. After you build the schedule for the first time, you may find that you forgot to define a constraint or that you need to add sections to a course. Make those changes and build the schedule again. It is likely that you will make changes and rebuild several times before you have a satisfactory schedule. 
After you decide on a master schedule, you have the option of allowing the system to optimize it. Then, finalize the master schedule before loading student schedules."
"# When to Commit the Master Schedule

Commit the master schedule when your schedule is as good as it can possibly be, school is no longer in session, and before running the end-of-year process. 

When you commit a master schedule, it replaces any existing master schedule for that school year.

To ensure that attendance is set up properly, your ""live side"" school year should be created before committing your schedule in PowerScheduler. Course information, including credit hours, is retrieved from the district level in PowerSchool when committing a master schedule.

Commit the Master Schedule
--------------------------

1. On the start page, choose PowerScheduler under Applications in the main menu.
2. Under Processing, choose Commit.
3. Select which schedules to copy:
    * Sections Only: Commit only sections.
    * Student Schedules Only: Commit only student schedules.
    * Sections & Student Schedules: Commit both sections and student schedules.
4. Select Suppress Classes for Associated Terms for Parent/Student Users to hide the classes for associated terms from parent and student users. 

5. Click Submit.
6. Click Submit. The Commit Master Schedule Warnings page displays any conflicts and unavailable courses.

7. If you are certain you want to commit, click Submit to proceed."
"# Commit the Master Schedule

When you have a satisfactory schedule and want to make it your master schedule for the next school year, you must commit it. Once a schedule is committed, it replaces any existing master schedule and becomes your current schedule.

You can commit the schedule as soon as the current academic year has ended, or you can wait until just before the next academic year begins. If your periods for the next academic year are set up exactly as they are for the current year, you can commit the schedule as soon as you are confident that you no longer need to build or load.

Note: If you use PowerScheduler to create a master schedule, you should commit your master schedule before running the End-of-Year Process. The End-of-Year process modifies each student's Next School Indicator and Next Year Grade. If PowerScheduler is used after running the End-of-Year process, it is likely that students will be scheduled for the wrong school or grade level.

For information about committing the master schedule, see When to Commit the Master Schedule."
"# Load Constraints

Load constraints restrict the way PowerScheduler loads students into courses in the master schedule.

PowerSchool includes six types of definable load constraints. Each constrain student schedules in a specific way. For example, use a Student Preference constraint to force a student to be scheduled in a particular teacher's section.

Note: Since constraints restrict student schedules, the more constraints you define, the less flexibility the system has to load students into courses and the less optimal the resulting schedule will be. It is always best to use the fewest number of constraints required to accomplish your scheduling goals.

Load constraints differ from build constraints, which are defined before building a master schedule. For information about build constraints, see Build Constraints."
"# Work with Load Constraints

After creating load constraints, you can view them by choosing Constraints under the Resources heading from the PowerScheduler menu. Select the constraint you created to view the constraints by type.

To view constraints that affect courses, sections, students, or teachers, choose the appropriate resource from the PowerScheduler menu. Then, view the constraints by choosing Constraints from the pop-up menu. The Constraints page displays all constraints that affect that resource, regardless of type.

Use the PowerScheduler menu to view the constraints by type or to modify or delete constraints.

"# Checklist to Know Your Student Schedules are Complete

The following is a checklist you can use to be sure that your student schedules are complete:

* You built a master schedule.
* You worked on conflicts, identified patterns, and corrected problems.
* You updated your master schedule.
* You optimized your master schedule. (optional)
* You ran a load.
* You checked your balances.
* You accommodated all student course requests. (optional)
* You reloaded and made any manual adjustments.
* Your balances are satisfactory.
* Your teacher schedules are satisfactory."
"# Lock Student Schedules

If you manually adjusted students' course requests and are satisfied with the resulting schedules, you can effectively lock those students' schedules before reloading by excluding them from the student selection before reloading. That way, only the selected students are included in the load.

Note: If one of the students in the selection has an association with another student, such as a Student Avoid constraint, the schedule of the ""other"" student not included in the selection may be affected by the load process.

For more information about selecting students, see Select Students for Scheduling. "
"# Load Students

When using PowerSchool to create a complete master schedule, you need to be familiar with both building and loading a master schedule.

The build process creates the master schedule by placing courses in specific rooms during certain periods and scheduling teachers to instruct those courses. The load process places students in a schedule that has been or is being created, based on their course requests. Effectively, the build creates the master schedule and the load creates the student schedules.

Although students are loaded into the schedule as it is building, this is not necessarily an optimal load. Students who are loaded into the schedule earlier have an advantage over those loaded later. Their course requests are more likely to be met. Also, while these students may be fully or close to fully scheduled, theirs may not be the best possible schedule that the system can create based on the completed master schedule.

When the students' schedules were created during the build process, the best possible schedules were chosen for them at that time; however, the build was not complete and optimized, and the system could not take into account any changes made to the schedule after they were loaded.

Note: The build function only does one pass; it does not go back to review better alternatives for courses already scheduled.

Once you have built a satisfactory master schedule, you can begin fine-tuning student schedules by running a load. While this function has no impact on the number of students enrolled in courses, it could have a positive effect on section balances. For example, it is possible that during your first load, you gain eight students in one course, five students in another, and ten in a third. Then, you can try again to help individual students get all of their course requests.

Do not load students into your master schedule until you are satisfied with it. Loading will not have any impact on the structure of the schedule, just on the placement of students within it. Also, do not make manual adjustments to student schedules and then reload students because the system will overwrite all of the changes you made. 
Loading is required in most cases. You need to load if you entered alternate course requests or global substitutions, or if you chose to close course sections at a maximum number. The build process does not handle these factors, which are not considered unless you load. Also, if you are making manual adjustments to your master schedule, you need to do a load under most circumstances. 

After running a load, analyze the results. For more information, see Analyze the Results. After analysis, proceed with one of the steps outlined in the section Post-Load Options."
"# Post-Load Options

After completing your first load, you can do one or more of the following procedures:

1. Accept the results of the load and begin manually adjusting student schedules. Select this option only if you are certain that the master schedule will not change and that student schedules are correct. Verify student schedules to make sure the master schedule is correct. For more information about adjusting student schedules, see Manually Adjust Student Schedules.
2. Resolve student conflicts by using or adding alternate course requests if you did not use them in the first load. If your schedule contains alternate student course requests but you did not allow the system to use them, rerun the load and select the substitutes options. For more information about creating alternate course requests, see Enter Requests in the Scheduling Area.
3. Manually adjust student course requests to allow better scheduling. For example, if a student has a course request that is impossible to meet, change it. Repeat this process until you are satisfied with the results. For more information about adjusting alternate course requests, see Enter Requests in the Scheduling Area.
4. Select the students you want to reschedule. Then, reload student schedules. 
    If you select option 2, 3, or 4 above, you probably need to reload student schedules. For more information, see Reload Students. 
    In the event that the unsatisfactory load results are due to discrepancies in the master schedule, you need to rebuild or manually adjust the master schedule. For more information, see Restart the Build."

"# Run a Load
Adjusting the master schedule potentially affects and causes conflicts for many students' schedules. For example, moving a course section to a different period may satisfy a number of unmet course requests, but this action can cause problems with others course requests.

As a result, whenever you change the master schedule, you need to reload students. You can also load students to see if the system can create better schedules for all students. Do this after you finish building a master schedule or if you made a number of changes to the schedule.

After running a load, import student schedules and then analyze the results. For more information, see Analyze the Results. After analysis, proceed with one of the steps outlined in the section Post-Load Options.

When performing a load, consider the following:

* Load priority is used to determine which substitutions should be made as well as which requests should go unfilled, if that is necessary. The engine always prefers to use substitutions instead of leaving a request unfilled, even if that means using a substitution on an important course instead of leaving an elective course unfilled.
* Load priorities are not a rank ordering. They are an importance rating. One request for a course with a load priority of 5 is equivalent to two requests with a 10 priority, three with a 15 priority, or four with a 20 priority. That means that, while these courses may have a priority of 5 and other courses have a priority of 10, it is just as good for the engine to leave the priority 5 unfilled as it is to leave two priority 10 courses unfilled; it is actually better for the engine to leave one priority 5 unfilled than to leave two courses with priority 9 or lower unfilled.



    For example, if a student has two 7 requests and one 5 request; while neither of the 7 requests can be filled outright, they both have substitutions; the substitutions, however, conflict with the 5 course, so the student can't get both. Therefore, it is better for the engine to miss the 5 and fill the two 7 requests with substitutions than it would be to leave the 7s unfilled and get the 5.

* To rate a course as really important, assign it a load priority of 1 or 10. For all other courses, rank according to how important they are relative to that 1 (or 10) course (even if that means using numbers like 1000). Then, as a second pass, double or quadruple their load priorities if any of those are semester or quarter courses.

"# Master Schedule Reports

Before building your master schedule, use the pre-build reports to determine that the scenario information is correct and view how student course requests will affect your schedule for the next school year. For example, run the Course Request Tally report if there are more requests than you originally planned for a particular course. You can then adjust the section count before building. For pre-build reports, see Prepare to Build the Master Schedule Reports.

You can also view reports to display which teachers are assigned to which courses and print a teacher assignments list. The teacher reports only display the names of teachers who are already assigned to courses.

After you build a master schedule, use the post-build reports to help you correct any errors in your data, such as non-scheduled course requests, non-scheduled student requests, and under-scheduled students. You can also use these reports to view your room utilization, a list of student schedules, and your new master schedule. For post-build reports, see Build the Master Schedule Reports."

"# Run the Individual Student Conflict Matrix Report
Use the Individual Student Conflict Matrix report to identify whether it is possible to rearrange a student's schedule so that more or all of their course requests can be fulfilled.

In the process of scheduling, it is inevitable that some students will not have all their requests fulfilled. This is often due to limited resource availability but it can also be due to inherent limitations of using a scheduling engine. At some point, the effort that the engine expends investigating the different possibilities of a schedule runs into diminishing returns. While PowerSchool's scheduling engine often reaches into the 90 percent fulfillment of requests range, manual intervention is necessary at some point to achieve an even higher percentage. Often it requires investigating students to identify why all of their requests were not scheduled.

While PowerSchool provides reports that identify unfilled requests, you must investigate various other reports to determine how, or even if, a particular request can be filled. Questions that a scheduling administrator might ask include: ""Are any of the sections of the requested class available during an unscheduled period for the student?"", ""If not, can I reschedule a filled class so that the student can be scheduled into the missed one?"", ""Is there enough room in another class so that I can squeeze the student in?"". This report provides sufficient information for an administrator to begin answering these questions.

Note: As an example, consider four sections: Course A1 with no section type, Course A2 with a section type of Bilingual, Course B1 with no section type, and Course B2 with a section type of Bilingual. If a student requests Course A1 with an alternate of Course B and gets enrolled in B so that it appears as an alternate on the report, the report displays both sections of Course B but only one section of Course A. The same result appears if the student does not request Course B as a primary or alternate request but is enrolled in the course, anyway; all sections appear on the report regardless of section type.

1. On the start page, choose PowerScheduler under Applications in the main menu. 
2. Under Tools, choose Reports from the PowerScheduler menu. 
3. Click Individual Student Conflict Matrix.

"# PowerScheduler
On this page:

Without the proper tools, building a school's master schedule can be a difficult and time-consuming process. When you build a schedule, you must not only consider periods and classes, but also student course requests, teacher schedules, teacher course requests, and dozens of other factors that make it a difficult process.

PowerSchool considers all schedule factors and determines the best possible schedule from hundreds of thousands of possibilities. The resulting master schedule satisfies the most requirements and minimizes the most conflicts.

Building a school's master schedule is done in four phases:

* Prepare to Build the Master Schedule
* Build Master Schedule Introduction
* Load Students
* Commit the Master Schedule

Much of the work necessary to create a master schedule must be completed before building the schedule. To prepare to build a master schedule, you must define scheduling parameters, such as courses and classrooms, and enter student course requests, teacher assignments, course information, and schedule constraints. The system weighs all of the parameters that you define and generates the best possible master schedule.

Because there are many ways to arrange a master schedule, you can create test scenarios using your data and different variables to determine the best possible results for your school. For example, you might create several different scenarios containing more or fewer constraints to determine how the system arranges your courses. You can save and modify these scenarios as you work toward the best possible master schedule.

Complete all of the steps in the section Prepare to Build the Master Schedule before you can proceed to the section Build Master Schedule Introduction . After building, load student requests into the master schedule and commit the master schedule to PowerSchool.

Generally, schools follow the build, load, then commit process when creating their master schedules. Though this suggested series of steps applies to most situations, there are exceptions. For example, you can build a master schedule without loading student schedules; instead, you could import student schedules. However, doing so will not take into consideration section size maximums or load constraints. You can also load schedules without first building a master schedule if you copy or import schedules or if you manually built a master schedule.

During both the preparing and building phases of this process, you will likely want to run certain reports. See Master Schedule Reports for descriptions of scheduling reports that you may use. There are several checklists to help you throughout the process. For more information, see Checklists .

When you click PowerScheduler on the start page, the Scheduling page displays for each scenario the name, date of the last master schedule build, last load of the student schedules into the master schedule, number of students with requests and satisfied requests after the last load, and percentage of students without scheduling conflicts.

Note: The Students With Requests and Students Without Conflicts statistics only update after the build or the load finish completely.

The status of each scenario appears. Only one scenario can be active at any given time; the others are considered inactive. Also, the Scheduling page displays for each scenario the percent of students scheduled, the percent of core requests scheduled, and the percent of satisfied student course requests.

The PowerScheduler menu displays the main scheduling functions, which are designed and sequenced to help you build your master schedule. The main scheduling functions list is divided into the following functional areas:"
"# Requesting
* Course Groups: Create course groups in preparation for creating request forms.
* Screen Setup: Create the request forms that will be used for entering student course requests.# Scheduling Setup
* Scenarios: Maintain your schedule scenarios. You can select a scenario or create a new one.
* Auto. Scheduler Setup: Set up certain defaults for build scenarios. This is the starting point when building a master schedule, since you must begin by setting up the Scheduling Years and Terms, Days, and Periods before you can proceed with building your master schedule.

"# Build Constraints Overview
On this page:

Build constraints restrict the way the system schedules a course in the master schedule. Use constraints to tell the system exactly how you want to build your schedule.

PowerSchool includes many types of build constraints you can define. Use each constraint to constrain the schedule in a specific way. For example, use a Teacher Free constraint if you want the football coach to have a free period at the end of the day during the fall semester. Alternatively, to preschedule the Wind Ensemble course at a particular time and place, use a Pre-Schedule constraint.

Note: Since constraints restrict the schedule, the more constraints you define, the less flexibility the system has to build your schedule and the less optimal the resulting schedule will be. It is always best to use the fewest number of constraints required to accomplish your scheduling goals.

The most common constraints are Pre-Schedule and Teacher Free. There are also constraints to manage course and teacher teams and to restrict the meeting times of courses. 
You do not have to define any constraints if you can build a satisfactory master schedule without them. Schools often start building schedules with only a few constraints, then gradually add new ones to refine the schedule and achieve particular results. 

After creating constraints, you can edit and delete them as necessary. For more information, see Work with Build Constraints. In addition to build constraints, you can set constraints during the load process. For information about load constraints, see Load Constraints."
"# Build Constraints
Build constraints restrict the actual building of the master schedule. To view a list of build constraints and the number of each that have been defined for your schedule, choose Build Constraints from the constraints menu. For teacher-related build constraints, see Teacher Build Constraints.# Add a Course Optimize Constraint
Use a Course Optimize constraint to override the global sampling parameters when scheduling a specific course. For example, if you have a course that you know will be very difficult to schedule, increase both the minimum number of combinations to sample and sampling percentage using this constraint.

Note: You can only define one Course Optimize constraint per course.

1. On the start page, choose PowerScheduler under Applications in the main menu. 
2. Under Scheduling Setup, choose Constraints from the PowerScheduler menu. 
3. Under Build Constraints, choose Course Optimize. 
4. Click New. 
5. Use the following table to enter information in the fields:

    ```
    ""Field"",""Description""
    ""Course Number"",""Click Associate to select the course you want to optimize.""
    ""Minimum number of combinations to sample"",""Enter the minimum number of combinations you want the system to sample when scheduling this course into the master schedule. For example, if this field on the Edit Build Scenario page is set for 10,000 and you have a course you know will be difficult to schedule, enter 50,000 so that the system will evaluate five times as many combinations as it does for your other courses.""
    ""Sampling Percentage"",""Enter the percentage of combinations you want the system to sample when scheduling this course into the master schedule. For example, if this field on the Edit Build Scenario page is set for 75% and you have a course you know will be difficult to schedule, enter 100 to have the system evaluate all possible combinations.""
    ```

6. Click Submit."
"# Add a Course Restriction Constraint
Use a Course Restriction constraint to restrict sections of a course to particular periods and days or to meet any time except the specified periods and days. 
For example, use this constraint to force three sections of a five-section course to schedule at the same time. The system normally spreads the sections out over different periods. With this constraint, you can force them to be scheduled where you want. 

1. On the start page, choose PowerScheduler under Applications in the main menu. 
2. Under Scheduling Setup, choose Constraints from the PowerScheduler menu. 
3. Under Build Constraints, choose Course Restrict. 
4. Click New. 
5. Use the following table to enter information in the fields:

    ""Minimum Number of Sections"",""Enter the minimum number of sections you want to restrict. Note: If the Minimum Number of Sections and Maximum Number of Sections fields are both 0, then this course can be taught in any period or day except the ones indicated.""
    ""Maximum Number of Sections"",""Enter the maximum number of sections you want to restrict. Note: If the Minimum Number of Sections and Maximum Number of Sections fields are both 0, then this course can be taught in any period or day except the ones indicated.""
    ""Section Type"",""If the course section you want to restrict has a section type, use the pop-up menu to choose it. If a course has five sections and the two sections you want to restrict contain section types, you must create two constraints.""
    ```

6. Click Submit.# Add a Course Room Constraint
Use a Course Room constraint to assign a course to a particular room. For example, you could force the Computer-Aided Drafting class to be taught in the Computer Lab rather than the Shop.

1. On the start page, choose PowerScheduler under Applications in the main menu.
2. Under Scheduling Setup, choose Constraints from the PowerScheduler menu. 
3. Under Build Constraints, choose Course Room.

    ```

6. Click Submit."
"# Add a Course Team Constraint
Use a Course Team constraint to block teachers and courses together so that certain courses can only be taught at the same time as certain other courses. For example, a jazz band instructor can only teach a jazz band course when a jazz choir instructor leads a jazz choir class (or vice versa). 
A blocking course relationship requires Course 1 and Course 2 to have the exact same number of sections. A Course Team constraint allows Course 1 and Course 2 to offer different numbers of sections, as long as there is at least one section of each using the blocking specified. For more information, see Course Information. 

Note: The order of the courses is irrelevant when creating this constraint.

1. On the start page, choose PowerScheduler under Applications in the main menu. 
2. Under Scheduling Setup, choose Constraints from the PowerScheduler menu. 
3. Under Build Constraints, choose Course Team. 
4. Click New.

    ""Same Room?"",""Select the checkbox to force both courses to be scheduled in the same room.""
    ""Minimum Number of Teaming Sections"",""Enter the minimum number of sections of these courses that will be teamed together. For example, if each course has four sections but you enter 2 in this field, then only two of the four sections will be teamed.""
    ```

6. Click Submit.# Add a Pre-Schedule Constraint
Use a Pre-Schedule constraint to schedule sections of a course ahead of time when you already know exactly when and where they must meet in the master schedule. For example, use this constraint to schedule sections of Band in sixth and seventh periods, which is the only time the band teacher is available.

1. On the start page, choose PowerScheduler under Applications in the main menu. 
2. Under Scheduling Setup, choose Constraints from the PowerScheduler menu. 
3. Under Build Constraints, choose Pre-Schedule. 
4. Click New. 
5. Use the following table to enter information in the fields:

    ```
    ""Field"",""Description""
    ""Course Number"",""Click Associate to select the number of the course you want to preschedule.""

    ""Team Code"",""If the section of the course you want to pre-schedule is associated with a teacher team, use the pop-up menu to choose it.""
    ```

6. Click Submit."
"# Add a Room Free Constraint
Use a Room Free constraint to block a room from being scheduled for a particular term, day, and period. For example, use this constraint to keep a classroom free during the last period of the day for after-school detention.

1. On the start page, choose PowerScheduler under Applications in the main menu. 
2. Under Scheduling Setup, choose Constraints from the PowerScheduler menu. 
3. Under Build Constraints, choose Room Free.

    ```
    ""Field"",""Description""
    ""Room"",""Click Associate to select room you want to keep free when scheduling.""
    ""Schedule"",""Use the pop-up menu to select the term in which this constraint applies. Select the checkbox next to each period in each day that you want to keep this room free. For example, select the checkboxes across the first row if you want to keep the room free during the first period of each day.""
    ```

6. Click Submit.# Add a Schedule Break Constraint
Use a Schedule Break constraint to add flexibility to teachers' max-in-a-row count. For example, if your teachers can instruct a maximum of three periods in a row, work around this by putting a 10-minute homeroom period after Period 2. This would make it possible to schedule teachers for Periods 1 through 5.

1. On the start page, choose PowerScheduler under Applications in the main menu. 
2. Under Scheduling Setup, choose Constraints from the PowerScheduler menu. 
3. Under Build Constraints, choose Schedule Break.
4. Click New.

6. Click Submit."
"# Teacher Build Constraints
Teacher-related build constraints consider teachers' restrictions when building a master schedule. To view a list of build constraints and the number of each that have been defined for your schedule, choose Build Constraints from the constraints menu. For other build constraints, see Build Constraints.# Add a Teacher Dovetail Constraint
Use a Teacher Dovetail constraint to fit partial courses together during the same period so that they take up less room.

For example, Course 1 is a partial course that meets three times during a six-day schedule cycle. Course 2 is a partial course taught by the same teacher and also meets three days in the cycle. Use this constraint to force both courses to meet during the same period, but on alternate days. Together the partial courses act as a full course, allowing greater flexibility in that teacher's schedule.

Note: You only have to define this constraint for one of the courses you want to fit together with another course.

1. On the start page, choose PowerScheduler under Applications in the main menu. 
2. Under Scheduling Setup, choose Constraints from the PowerScheduler menu. 
3. Under Build Constraints, choose Teacher Dovetail.

"# Build Scenarios Overview
On this page:

A build scenario includes the parameters that PowerScheduler references to create a master schedule for the upcoming school year. Use scenarios to work with different combinations of criteria before committing a master schedule. After completing a successful build for a scenario, you can duplicate it and try various modifications to the original scenario.

Though you can create multiple build scenarios, it is suggested that you start with just one. Multiple scenarios may be useful when, for example, your school wants to hire an additional computer science teacher to meet student course request demands. In this case, create two build scenarios: one that includes the additional computer science teacher and one that does not. Present both scenarios to the school committee to make a final decision on which situation would work best.

Some information used to create a master schedule is shared amongst all scenarios, whereas other information is defined per scenario. The following data is exclusive to a particular build scenario:

* Master schedule
* Student schedules
* Constraints
* Course rank
* Teacher assignments
* Course relationships

For example, if you define the constraint that Mrs. Smith must be free first period for the Schedule 1 scenario, the Schedule 2 scenario does not adhere to that constraint. 
The following information is shared by all build scenarios that you create for a given build year: 

* Students
* Student course requests
* Student course request pages
* Teachers
* Rooms
* All parameters (such as terms)
* Course groups

For example, if you enter a student course request, the system tries to schedule that request in all scenarios. 
For more information about build scenarios, including how to create a build scenario, see Build Scenarios."
"# Build Scenarios
Before creating build scenarios, define the basic build information, such as the number of terms, days, and periods in your master schedule. Then, define optimization parameters, which determine how long the system spends scheduling each course, section, and student.

When building the master schedule, PowerSchool evaluates every possible schedule combination before it adds a course to that schedule. Depending on your school's courses, constraints, and other schedule parameters, there could be millions of ways to schedule one multi-section course. Evaluating all of these schedule combinations would take many hours. You might not want to wait for such a thorough evaluation. If this is the case, define build and load optimizations to determine how many combinations the system should review when building your schedule.

When you enter optimization parameters, you define the minimum and maximum number of possibilities the system should evaluate while doing the following:

* Building the master schedule
* Loading student schedules with courses

You can also define best schedule weights to determine how the system handles conflicts when building your master schedule. For example, if you give more weight to section balance than to student conflicts, the system tries to create similar-size course sections before it tries to accommodate student course requests. Based on the last load for each scenario, the percent of students scheduled, core courses scheduled, and satisfied student requests appear on the Scenarios page."

"# Course Information
On this page:

Define scheduling preferences for each course in your course catalog. These preferences control how PowerSchool builds your master schedule. 

The process the system uses to schedule students for courses is similar to the process of constructing a wall of bricks. The master schedule is the wheelbarrow of available bricks. Each brick used to build the walls is a course section in your course catalog. A good master schedule will have enough bricks of appropriate shapes and sizes to build solid walls for every student.

Building walls without gaps requires that the bricks all fit together. If your bricks come in different shapes, this can be a challenge. For example, a course that meets every day and all year long will have a very different shape from another course that meets every other day for one semester. Building a wall with all types of bricks requires that the wheelbarrow (master schedule) contain the right variety of bricks (course sections) from which to choose."

However, Freshman English has a Terms Per Year value of 4, which means this course meets all four terms in the year.Terms Per Year are related to the number of terms you set in the build scenario. Remember that the Terms Per Year value equals the lowest common denominator (LCD) of all scheduling terms. For example, if a school has trimesters, semesters, and quarters, the LCD is 12. For a semester course, the Terms Per Year value would be 6, or half of the schedule terms; a trimester course would have a Terms Per Year value of 4, and a quarterly course would have a Terms Per Year value of 3.""

"# Define Related Courses
For each course, you can define related courses. The system uses these course relationships when building the schedule. Relate courses to alert the system that it must consider other courses when determining the best place for a course in the master schedule.

For example, if a teacher can instruct multiple special education courses at one time in the same room, you can relate the courses so that the system knows it is possible to do so.

If you define a relationship for a course with another course, you do not have to define the relationship for both courses. But, you can define the relationship for both courses so that it is easy to identify this relationship regardless of which course you are viewing.

1. On the start page, choose PowerScheduler under Applications. 
2. Under Resources, choose Courses. 
3. Click the name of the course you want to work with from the courses menu.
4. Do one of the following: 

    1. * Choose Relationships.
        * Click Relationships.



5. Click New. 
6. Use the following table to enter information in the fields:

    ```
    ""Field"",""Description""
    ""Course Number"",""Click Associate to select the number of the course for which you want to define a relationship.""
    ""Relationship Type"",""Choose one of the following options:Is Blocked for Building With: This relationship type is used for building a master schedule. Courses that must be related to one another in the schedule. For example, you may want pottery to be scheduled before or after ceramics so that they can share a hot kiln. Alternatively, a medieval literature class may follow a medieval history class.May Be Built Concurrent With: This relationship type is used for building a master schedule. Courses that can meet at the same time, in the same place, and be taught by the same teacher. For example, a special education teacher might have a class of ten students, three of whom are taking remedial reading and the remainder of whom study remedial vocabulary and spelling. Note: When two courses are blocked simultaneously and share the same teachers, there is no need to add a concurrent relationship between the two courses. Also, the PowerScheduler engine propagates concurrent relationships amongst courses that share a concurrent relationship. For example, if Course A has a concurrent relationship with Course B and Course B has a concurrent relationship with Course C, there is no need to add a concurrent relationship between Course A and Course C. Has a Load Coreq of: Two courses that are scheduled during the same term of a student's schedule. The term of one section must be the same as or a subsection of the term of the other section. For example, if one of the courses is scheduled in Semester 1, then the other may be Semester 1, Trimester 1, or Quarter 1 or Quarter 2. Though a Trimester 2 course overlaps a Semester 1 course, the courses cannot have a """"coreq"""" relationship type.Has a Load Postreq of: A course that must be in a student's schedule in a term after the related course. The course you associate using the Course Number field will be scheduled after the currently selected course. The term of the first section must end before the term of the second section begins. For example, Course B is a post-requisite of Course A. When the system schedules a student for these courses, it ensures that Course B is scheduled into a term after the student is scheduled for Course A.Has a Load Prereq of: A course that must be in a student's schedule in a term before the related course. The course you associate using the Course Number field must be scheduled before the currently selected course. The term of the first section must start after the term of the second section ends. For example, Course A is a prerequisite of Course B. When the system schedules a student for these courses, it ensures that Course A is scheduled into a term before the student is scheduled for Course B.Must Not Load Coreq With: The courses cannot be scheduled in the same term or sub-term. For example, if Course A is scheduled for Semester 1, then Course B may be scheduled for Trimester 2 or Trimester 3 but not Trimester 1. This relationship is bi-directional; that is, if you indicate that Course A """"Must Not Load Coreq With"""" Course B, then Course B is automatically set to """"Not Load Coreq With"""" Course A.Must Load Distinct (no term overlap) With: The courses cannot load into overlapping terms. For example, if Course A is scheduled for Semester 1, then Course B may be scheduled for Trimester 3 but not Trimester 1 or Trimester 2. This is also a bi-directional relationship type.Must Load the Term After: The course must load in the next term. For example, if Course A is scheduled for Quarter 1, then Course B may be scheduled in Quarter 2 but not Quarters 1, 3, or 4. Likewise, if Course A is scheduled for Semester 1, then Course B may be scheduled in Quarter 3 or Semester 2. To indicate the reverse of this relationship type, see the """"Must Load the Term Before"""" option.Must Load the Term Before: The course must load in the previous term. For example, if Course A is scheduled for Quarter 3, then Course B may be scheduled in Quarter 2 but not Quarters 1, 3, or 4. To indicate the reverse of this relationship type, see the """"Must Load the Term After"""" option.Note: Coreq, Postreq, and Prereq only relate to the current scheduling year. The system does not check historical data for previous courses.""
    ""Relationship Code"",""If you selected a relationship type of Block, you must define a relationship code. Choose one of the following options:Simultaneous: The blocked course must be scheduled at the same time as the current course. If the same teacher instructs both courses, they must also be concurrent. Simultaneously blocked courses can have different attributes, such as numbers of sections, different frequencies, and different teachers. The courses can be scheduled at the same time with different teachers in different rooms. Note: The PowerScheduler engine propagates simultaneous relationships amongst courses that share a simultaneous relationship and have the same number of sections. For example, if Course A is blocked simultaneously with Course B, Course B is blocked simultaneously with Course C, and courses A, B, and C have the same number of sections, there is no need to add a simultaneous block relationship between Course A and Course C. Before or After: The blocked course must be scheduled either before or after the current course.Before: The selected course must be scheduled before the course you associate using the Course Number field. The blocked course selected in the Course Number field must be scheduled after the current course.After: The selected course must be scheduled after the course you associate using the Course Number field. The blocked course selected in the Course Number field must be scheduled before the current course.Different Terms: Two courses occur on the same days and periods, but in different terms.Combine Into: Combine courses that have different student requests but have the same teacher and the same attributes, such as frequency, periods per meeting, valid start periods, and number of sections. Since the PowerScheduler engine processes combined courses as a single course, select an """"anchor"""" course in the Course Number field from which you can combine additional courses. For example, a combined block relationship is applied to English I, English II, English III, which are all are taught by the same teacher but were requested by different students. Those three courses will be scheduled at the same time with the same teacher in the same room. When editing course relationships for English II and English III, associated English I as the anchor course for each combined relationship.Opposite Days: Two courses occur during the same period and term but on alternate days.Section: The blocked course must have the same students in each section as the current course. For example, all students in section 1 of the blocked course must be in section 1 of the current course.""

"# Calculate Target Number of Sections to Offer
Use the Calculate Target Number of Sections to Offer page if you want the system to calculate the recommended number of sections to offer for each course in the current catalog. When calculating the number of sections to offer for each course, PowerScheduler divides the total number of primary requests for that course by the maximum enrollment per section. Any remainders in this calculation are rounded up to provide the necessary number of sections for the number of requests. For example, if 215 students request a Biology course and the maximum number of students in each section is 25, the system calculates a need for 9 sections of Biology.

Before you continue, you must enter a value in the Maximum Enrollment field on the Course Information page. For more information, see Define Scheduling Preferences.# Calculate Target Number of Sections to Offer
The Calculate Target Number of Sections to Offer function calculates the recommended number of sections to offer for each course in the current catalog, based upon the number of course requests, the course maximum enrollment, and whether students may repeat the class in a given school year. Be sure to enter scheduling preferences for all of your courses before using this function. For more information, see Define Scheduling Preferences.

1. On the start page, choose PowerScheduler under Applications. 
2. Under Tools, choose Functions. 
3. Click Calculate Target Number of Sections to Offer.

"# Course Rank
On this page:

Building a course rank is the last step before building the master schedule.

The course rank file defines the order in which the system schedules courses into the master schedule. The rank is a value that a course is given according to how difficult it is to schedule. As the system fills the master schedule with courses during the build, it becomes more and more difficult to schedule each successive course. Therefore, the order in which the system schedules courses is important. The best course rank places the courses that are the most difficult to schedule at the beginning of the build process and saves the courses that are easiest to schedule for the end.

For example, singletons (courses that are offered only once per term) are scheduled before regular courses because they are more difficult to fit in a schedule. The system schedules prescheduled courses first, and then schedules singletons, doubletons, core sections, and electives.

Demand for a course (the number of student course requests) and constraints on a course affect course rank. The system initially builds the course rank based on constraints and other parameters that you defined. 
It is important to keep the course rank file up-to-date as you build your schedule and adjust your courses, teachers, constraints, and other parameters. 

The first time you build the course rank, the system creates a rank file. As you build your schedule and adjust parameters, such as courses, teachers, and constraints, the rank file needs to be updated. For more information, see Build Course Rank."
"# Build Course Rank
When you initially build the course rank, the system displays the courses in the order the system has determined, based on the course definitions and constraints. 
The system assigns a sequential number to each course to indicate its place in rank using numbers in increments of ten, such as 10, 20, 30. The smaller the number, the higher the course rank. 

Use this numbering system to edit the ranks of courses and put courses between system-defined ranks. For example, you can re-rank a course to 11, 12, or 13 without affecting the ranks of the system-defined courses ranked at 10 and 20.

After building the course rank and making modifications, you may need to rebuild the course rank. Rebuilding the course rank overwrites any changes you have made to the rank file. Rebuild the course rank after you add or delete a course. If you rebuild the rank, you will lose any edits you made. Be sure to make note of those changes so that you can re-create them in the rebuilt course rank. To rebuild the course rank, see Build Initial Course Rank. To rebuild the rank without updating your manual changes, use the Update Rank function. For more information, see Update Rank.# Build Initial Course Rank
Use this function to set up an initial course rank or rebuild a course rank. This will overwrite any manual changes to the course rank.

1. On the start page, choose PowerScheduler under Applications in the main menu. 
2. Under Processing, choose Course Rank from the PowerScheduler menu. 
3. Click Build Rank. 
4. Click Submit."
"# Edit a Course Rank
After creating an initial rank file, you can modify, update, and rebuild it. These are the final steps before building the master schedule.

The system evaluates all factors that affect courses to determine the best course rank. After the system builds the course rank, you can make manual adjustments based on your own experience or special circumstances not reflected in the parameters and constraints you defined. The rank you manually give a course overrides the rank assigned by the system.

For example, the system calculates a course rank of 90 for Concert Band based on the constraints you entered for this course compared to the constraints you entered for other courses. Due to experience in dealing with the conflicts band members face when trying to schedule Concert Band, you decide to change the rank of this class. By changing the rank from 90 to 5, you force other courses to schedule around Concert Band, reducing the chance of conflicts.

Note: You cannot change the rank of a course to be higher than a prescheduled course. Prescheduled courses are always the first courses scheduled.

1. On the start page, choose PowerScheduler under Applications in the main menu.

"# Courses and Course Catalogs
On this page:

To work with the courses that will be part of next year's schedule, you must first add any new courses you plan to offer and associate them with your school. See New Courses. Then, create a course catalog to make course selections available for student course requests. After creating a course catalog, you can edit or delete that catalog, depending on your needs. See Course Catalogs.

Note: It is possible for students to request a course that is not part of your course catalog if that course has been associated with your school. 
Course relationships have consequences for how you manage new and modified courses. First, it is important to understand the ways to view courses and how those views are connected: 

1. Course List (Start Page > District or School > Courses). This page lists all courses on the server and is the central point from which you can manage courses and course-related information at both the district and school 
2. Available Courses for \[Year\] List (Start Page > School > Courses > Manage courses for this school). This page lists all courses on the server and is used to create new courses, as well as to make them active or inactive for the current school.
3. PowerScheduler Course Catalog (Start Page > PowerScheduler > Catalogs > Edit). This list matches what is listed on the PowerSchool School Course List. Indicate for each course if it is active for scheduling. When you submit this information, a new record is created for the course in a different table in PowerSchool's database. At that point, changes to courses listed in PowerSchool do not affect courses listed in PowerScheduler.

4. PowerScheduler School Course List (Start Page > PowerScheduler > Courses). This list includes the selected courses from the Scheduling Course Catalog. Selecting courses to be scheduled does not affect this list of courses.

* Option 1: Leave everything as is and schedule using the old course name. After the end of the school year, change the course's name. This takes more thought because you must remember that you need to change the name at the end of the school year. Since you must change the course name regardless of which option you choose, no extra work is required.
* Option 2: Use DDA to search the SchedCourseCatalogs table for the course number. Be sure to search only within records belonging to your school, and make a backup of your data file before proceeding. Then, change the course name. This affects the course name in PowerScheduler.

In summary, view 4 is based on the selected courses of view 3, which, like view 2, is based on the selected courses of view 1. This means that to add a course to PowerScheduler, you must first add a course to the Available Courses for \[Year\] List (view 1). Then, in the Scheduling Course Catalog, select the checkbox next to the course and submit.

To change a course name but use same course number, there are two options. The first takes more thought but is easiest, whereas the second requires someone with the highest level of access to the database to make changes for you. Regardless of the option you choose, the current courses should not be modified at all if any of them are in use this school year by any school on the server. It is necessary to store grades using the courses' current names. Do not modify course names until you complete all necessary processes at the end of the school year. Also, changes made in PowerScheduler are void when you complete your master schedule and are ready to commit student schedules because the master schedule references courses in PowerSchool.

To change a course name but use same course number:

* * Option 1: Leave everything as is and schedule using the old course name. After the end of the school year, change the course's name. This takes more thought because you must remember that you need to change the name at the end of the school year. Since you must change the course name regardless of which option you choose, no extra work is required.
    * Option 2: Use DDA to search the SchedCourseCatalogs table for the course number. Be sure to search only within records belonging to your school, and make a backup of your data file before proceeding. Then, change the course name. This affects the course name in PowerScheduler."

Courses in the course catalog are copied from the district level. Not all courses on the district course list are available for the catalog; only courses that appear on the school's Available Courses for \[Year\] page can be included. For more information, see Edit Course Status.

You can edit information in the course catalog without affecting the courses on the school's Available Courses for \[Year\] page. For example, you may want to change the credit hours for a course for scheduling purposes, but revert to the course's real credit hours when committing schedules for the next school year. Once a master schedule is committed, the course information, including credit hours, is retrieved from the district level.

Note: You can have more than one course catalog, and it is not necessary to create a new catalog for each scheduling year. Course catalogs are associated with builds, and a catalog is only active when it is associated with the active build scenario. This also means that you can only edit courses in the catalog that is active. For more information, see Build Scenarios.

"# Prepare to Build the Master Schedule

Preparing to build the master schedule is the first of several phases in creating a master schedule. The process of preparing to build the master schedule consists of the following 11 steps:

1. Schedule Security
2. Scheduling Setup
3. Build Scenarios Overview
4. Courses and Course Catalogs
5. Rooms Overview
6. Student Information
7. Student Course Requests
8. Course Information
9. Teacher Scheduling Information
10. Build Constraints Overview
11. Course Rank

Most steps can be performed in any order, within reason. For example, you cannot enter teacher assignments if you have not entered all of your teachers on the teacher list. You also must define your schedule constraints before you calculate course rank.

To assign specific sections to several individuals, each person can perform a step at the same or different times. If you are the only person preparing to build your school's schedule, you should follow the steps in the above sequence."
"# PowerScheduler Scheduling Setup
On this page:

To build the master schedule to your school's specifications, you need to define pieces of information for the system to use to schedule courses at your school. These are called scheduling setup. Depending on your school's setup, not all scheduling setup need to be defined. Define the following scheduling setup before building a master schedule:

* Scenarios
* Auto. Scheduler Setup
* Course Catalogs
* Years and Terms
* Periods
* Days
* Buildings
* Departments
* Facilities
* Houses
* Section Types
* Teams
* Program Balancing"
"# Buildings
If your school campus contains several buildings, you can define each of them. Then, you can associate these buildings with students, teachers, and rooms. This way, the system knows to schedule courses in the appropriate building, taught by the appropriate teacher, and taken by the appropriate students.# Define a Building
1. On the start page, choose PowerScheduler under Applications in the main menu. 
2. Under Scheduling Setup, choose Buildings from the PowerScheduler menu. 
3. Click New. 
4. Enter a name for the building in the Building field.

4. Edit the name of the building in the Building field.
5. Click Submit.# Delete a Building
1. On the start page, choose PowerScheduler under Applications in the main menu. 
2. Under Scheduling Setup, choose Buildings from the PowerScheduler menu. 
3. Click the name of the building you want to delete. 
4. Click Delete."
"# Days
A day (or ""cycle"") is the number of repeating days that make up a schedule. The days are originally set up when you enter the number of days while creating the scenario or performing the Auto Scheduler Setup function.

To build a master schedule, PowerScheduler requires that days are defined. Prior to the start of the scheduling process, determine the numbers of days you will need in your schedule.

Note: A schedule day or cycle is NOT the same as a calendar day.# Define Days
1. On the start page, choose PowerScheduler under Applications in the main menu. 
2. Under Scheduling Setup, choose Days from the PowerScheduler menu.
3. Use the following table to enter information in the fields:

    ```
    ""Field"",""Description""
    ""Name"",""Enter the name of the day.""
    ""Abbreviation"",""Enter an abbreviation for the day name.""
    ```

4. Click Submit."
"# Departments
Courses, rooms, and teachers belong to departments. When building the master schedule, the system attempts to schedule courses in one of the rooms belonging to the appropriate department.

Use this function to set up departments. If you previously used PowerScheduler with departments, the departments also appear for this year.

Note: Be very careful to avoid typographical errors when defining departments. For example, if there is an existing SCIENCE department and you define a misspelled ""SCEIENCE"" department in PowerScheduler, the erroneously-named department will also exist when the schedule is committed since its name did not match the name of any existing department. It is a cumbersome task to clean up the data, as departments are associated to a number of tables, such as Teacher, Room, and Course.# Define a Department
1. On the start page, choose PowerScheduler under Applications in the main menu. 
2. Under Scheduling Setup, choose Departments from the PowerScheduler menu. 
3. Click New. 
4. Enter a name for the department in the Department field.

"# Facilities
Some courses require special equipment or facilities. For example, a chemistry course requires special laboratory equipment, and a film course requires audio and video equipment. Also, a chemistry course is taught in a laboratory and a physical education class is taught in a gymnasium. To associate courses that need special equipment or types of rooms, the system uses facilities.

Note: You can assign multiple facilities to courses and rooms.# Define a Facility
1. On the start page, choose PowerScheduler under Applications in the main menu. 
2. Under Scheduling Setup, choose Facilities from the PowerScheduler menu. 
3. Click New.

"# Houses
Some schools separate students into houses. For example, a school can have a House A (Grades 9 and 10) and a House B (Grades 11 and 12). Determine which rooms, teachers, and students belong to each house. If the ""Use houses"" checkbox is selected on the Edit Advanced Build Scenario page (see Edit Advanced Optimizations ), the system references which house a room is assigned to before scheduling courses in that room and gives scheduling priority to the appropriate house.

Also, sections will be scheduled for houses based on the house assignment of the teachers scheduled for those sections. Students assigned to a house will be assigned to a section either without a house or with the same house, whereas students not assigned a house can be assigned to any section.# Define a House
1. On the start page, choose PowerScheduler under Applications in the main menu. 
2. Under Scheduling Setup, choose Houses from the PowerScheduler menu. 
3. Click New.

"# Rooms Overview
On this page:

Your school's layout and classrooms are essential parts of the scheduling process. Entering all of the necessary room information allows the system to consider the most efficient use of available space when building the master schedule.

When performing the Schedule Parameters function, you defined the departments and facilities within your school. Now it is time to enter the rooms. To each room, you can associate specific departments and facilities so that the system schedules courses in the appropriate locations.

Note: Only enter classrooms needed for next year's schedule. For example, if you know you are not going to hold classes in a particular room, do not enter its information in the system. If a room that you will not use next year is in the system, you can leave it there as long as you make it unavailable for scheduling. For more information, see Edit a Room.

To ensure that there is a place for each section of a course to meet, you must schedule them into classrooms. The system assigns courses to rooms based on the following priorities (listed from highest to lowest priority):

* The assigned teacher's preferred classroom
* Any classroom associated with the same department as the course being scheduled
* Any classroom associated with the same department as the assigned teacher
* Any classroom with an adequate number of seats

Note: If the course requires a special facility, the system considers rooms that provide the necessary facility only. If no facility is available, then the system cannot schedule the course."

"# Student Course Requests
On this page:

Student course requests are critical to scheduling, whether you use PowerScheduler or Automated Walk-In (AWI) scheduling. During the PowerScheduler Build process, for example, Student Course Requests are utilized to determine how many sections of a course are required. During the Scheduler Load process or when using AWI scheduling, the Requests are used to place the students into their desired or required courses. Requests can also be used to make PowerScheduler and AWI scheduling load students into selected sections of a course.

When using PowerScheduler to build a master schedule or load students into courses, the goal is to satisfy as many student course requests and to have the most balanced schedule possible. Both PowerScheduler and AWI scheduling utilize student course requests when creating Master Schedules or Student Schedules.

Before creating student course request pages, some preparation is required. This involves setting up the schools on the PowerSchool server for the upcoming scheduling year, setting student scheduling preferences, adding any new courses, collecting the appropriate grade-level requirement information, and creating course groups and student request screens. Once complete, you can then begin building or loading schedules for the next school year.

The student course request process involves several steps. Complete these steps in the following order:

1. Create a scenario for each school before using PowerScheduler to build master schedules or load student schedules for each new scheduling year. It is recommended that you use Auto Schedule Setup to create a scenario for all schools in your district, whether or not the school will use PowerScheduler for scheduling purposes. That way, the appropriate students and their course requests will appear in the correct schools during the scheduling process. For more information, see Auto Scheduler Setup.
2. Set the schedule year for the upcoming year at all schools on the PowerSchool server. Approximate start and end dates for the new scheduling year will be required; these can be modified later, if necessary. For more information, see Set the Schedule Year.
3. Set the Next School, Next Year Grade, and Schedule This Student indicators for all active students using the Student Field Value and Next School group functions or by setting each student individually from the student's Schedule Setup page. These fields, with the exception of Next School, may also be mass-filled for each school using the Auto Fill Student Information function in PowerScheduler. Note that the Next School indicator must be set before using this function for those students who will be scheduled. For more information, see Auto Fill Student Information.
4. Add new courses to the Available Courses for \[Year\] page at any schools that will be using them for scheduling, then activate the courses in the course catalogs. For more information, see Course Catalogs.
5. Collect appropriate grade-level information. For more information about what information to gather, see Grade-Level Requirements.

6. Create course groups. For more information, see Course Groups.
7. Create student course request pages. For more information, see Student Course Request Pages.
8. Enter student course requests. For more information, see Student Course Request Entry."
"# Grade-Level Requirements
Determine the individual course requirements at your school, such as the names of required courses and number of credits students must take in each grade level. Having all of this information readily available for reference will make it much easier to create the student course request pages.

Collect the following information for each grade level:

* Required courses
* Number of credits that must be taken
* Possible semester elective courses
* Possible year-long elective courses
* Possible no-credit courses
* Number of terms for each request
* Before- or after-school courses
* Possible lunch periods

The following is an example of what you might collect for a ninth-grade request page:

```
""Information to Collect"",""Example""
""Required courses"",""One semester of each of the following: Software Applications 1, Software Applications 2, General Science 1, General Science 2, Health, Word ProcessingTwo semesters of English: English 9, English 9 Honors, or English 9 Basic SkillsTwo semesters of math: Consumer Math, Pre-Algebra, Algebra I, Algebra II, or Geometry""
""Number of credits that must be taken"",""Ninth graders must take 7 full credits (14 semester classes)""
""Possible semester electives"",""Woods I, Woods II, Beginning Pottery, Art I, Art II, Beginning Foods, Fitness for Life (PE), any other Physical Education class, any computer class""
""Possible year-long electives"",""Band, Chorus, Audition Choir, any first-year Foreign Language, Agriculture I, Horticulture I""
""Possible no-credit courses"",""Only students with special permission can take no-credit periods: Study Hall, Work Experience, released time for religious or other academic classes, Independent Study""
""Number of terms for each request"",""Each request will represent one semester of course material""
""Before- or after-school courses"",""No class will be offered to ninth graders before or after school""
""Possible lunch periods"",""Lunch is not part of the ninth grade student schedule""
```# Course Groups
To make it easier for students, parents, or staff members to enter requests, you have the option of creating course groups. Course groups represent the courses that are available to a student for a specific request.

For example, when eighth-grade students select a ninth-grade elective course for the next school year, they are presented with a list of valid ninth-grade elective course options. Students must make their selection from the list of courses that you determine are valid for a particular selection.

Note: It is recommended that course groups for scheduling use should only contain courses that require the same number of student course requests. For example, you should not combine single semester courses with year-long courses, as this could lead to an inaccurate count of requests and credit hours.

Create the lists by making a course group for all predetermined requirements. For example, in the case that you need to create six course groups for a particular grade level, you might create three groups for core courses, one for semester electives, one for year-long electives, and one for no credit electives.

```
""Course group"",""Example""
""Core courses"",""Software Application I and II, General Science 1 and 2, Health, Word Processing English 9: English 9, Honors, Basic Skills Mathematics 9: Consumer Math, Pre-Algebra, Algebra I, Algebra II, Geometry""
""Semester electives"",""Woods I, Woods II, Beginning Pottery, Art I, Art II, Beginning Foods, Fitness for Life (PE), any other Physical Education class, any computer class""
""Yearlong electives"",""Band, Chorus, Audition Choir, any first-year Foreign Language, Agriculture I, Horticulture I""
""No credit electives"",""Study Hall, Work Experience, Released Time, Independent Study""
```"
"# Create a Course Group

5. Click Confirm Delete."
"# Student Course Request Pages
Create course requirements and student course request pages for each grade level in the school. The course request pages contain courses you select for the various course groups from which students can make their selections. The request pages require students to select only courses and electives that have been approved for their grade level. If you need to make an exception, you can do so manually. For more information about grade-specific requirements, see Requirements.

Course Request Screens are relevant to whatever is selected as the scheduling year. The scheduling year also determines which Request Screen appears to parents and students. For example, if the current school year is 2011-2012 and the schedule year is set to 2012-2013, students who are in tenth grade during 2011-2012 will use the Grade 11 request screen. For more information, see Set the Schedule Year.

When creating a year, the corresponding registration records from the previous year are copied to the new year. If registration records already exist for the school and year, then the registration records are not copied."
"# Create a Request Screen in PowerScheduler
Because course requirements vary for each grade level, you can create new or edit existing course request pages for each grade level in your school. The Next School Indicator field points to the school students will attend next year. For example, a school district consists of two high schools and three junior high schools. An eighth-grader entering student course requests will view the request page for the high school set as his or her next school. Other eighth graders, whose next school is set to the other high school, would view a different request page.

Note: It is important to set all students' next school indicator, even if they stay at the same school next year. For more information, see Student Information.

1. On the start page, choose PowerScheduler under Applications in the main menu. 
2. Under Requesting, choose Screen Setup from the PowerScheduler menu.

"# Requirements
You must create requirement entries for each student course request. Requirement entries make up the body of the request page, informing students which courses they must take and giving them selections from valid course groups. For more information about student course request pages, see Student Course Request Pages. 
There are three types of requirement entries: 

* Single Course Requirement: Students make single selections from a course group. For example, if all eleventh graders need to take one computer course next year, create a Computer course group that includes all of the computer courses. Students select one of the courses from the list to fulfill their Computer requirement.
* Multi-Course Requirement: Students make multiple selections from a course group. For example, if all eleventh graders need to take two business courses next year, create a Business course group that includes all business courses. Students select two or more of the courses from the list to fulfill their Business requirement.
* Core Requirement: Students view a set of requests that are predefined, such as a core set of courses for all ninth graders. There are no options from which students can make selections.# Enter a Single Course Requirement in PowerScheduler

"# Student Information
On this page:

As part of the process of preparing to build your master schedule, you need to confirm that the appropriate students are available in your database for scheduling. Before the system can build the schedule, you must enter detailed scheduling information for each student.

For students who will attend your school next year, update the Next School Indicator along with the Next Year Grade, Priority, Year of Graduation, and the option to Schedule this Student. For students who will not attend your school next year, update the Next School Indicator along with the option to Schedule this Student.

In addition to the required settings, there are a number of optional settings you can use to assign students to houses, buildings, and teams.

It is easy to update for a group of students many of the required scheduling preferences fields, such as Next Year Grade and Schedule This Student. In certain circumstances, you may need to change or update a field for an individual student."

You can assign scheduling priorities to students for the system to follow when loading student schedules. Students can share the same priority.

For example, if there are more requests than available spots, you might want the system to schedule graduating students first because it is their last chance to take the courses they request. If this is the case, assign all twelfth graders a priority of 10, all eleventh graders a priority of 20, all tenth graders a priority of 30, and all ninth graders a priority of 40.

Note: Priority numbers can range from 1 to 999. The lower the number, the higher the priority. Some schools set priorities in increments of 10 to accommodate future modifications. Also, starting with 10 as the default priority number allows for special cases that need the highest priority to be given a number lower than 10."

7. Click Submit.# Scheduled Lunch
To schedule time for lunch or teacher-supervised breaks in your school's master schedule, create lunch sections. Lunch sections are sections of a course that have been designated for lunch periods. To schedule students for lunch, a lunch course request must exist for each student before loading student schedules.

Start by creating a lunch course in PowerScheduler, indicating that it will be used exclusively for scheduled lunches. Then, create sections for that course. Select the periods that each section of the lunch course will span and the days on which it occurs. For more information about specifying that a course is used for scheduling lunch, see Course Scheduling Setup.

For each section of a lunch course, PowerScheduler can assign a teacher to supervise during lunchtime. If supervision is not necessary, scheduling teachers for lunch ensures that the teachers will have time set aside for their own lunch break. Teachers can be assigned to only one lunch section per day, though that section can span several periods. Teachers are scheduled for one section of the lunch course for each day combination and term specified by the lunch course.

For example, a five-day, quarterly schedule where lunch can be periods 3, 5, or 7, set up the lunch course with a frequency of five, valid terms for each quarter, and valid start periods selected for 3, 5 and 7. Each teacher can be scheduled for one of 20 lunch sections (one for each day and term) that will start in either period 3, 5, or 7 in the respective day and term combination. 

Students can also request lunch courses. Each student must request the lunch course for each day combination and term. Students will be loaded into lunch sections that have no assigned teacher. Using the earlier example, students also have 60 sections in which they can be scheduled (three per day per term).

Though PowerScheduler schedules lunch courses in the same manner as other courses, you can filter lunch courses for certain reports and functions. When defining course scheduling preferences, specify that the course is excluded from report cards and transcripts. The course will not appear on those object reports. Also, lunch courses are not included in functions such as splitting year-long courses.

If you use the lunch functionality for any other teacher scheduling purpose, remember that you can only have one lunch course and that it must follow the same rules as scheduled lunch. That is, there should be only one period of time each day of the year in which teachers are assigned to this activity."
"# Automated Study Hall

That way, PowerScheduler can be more efficient by setting up study hall sections that span multiple days, if possible.For example, a five-day schedule could include the day patterns MWF, TR, and MTF. PowerScheduler would first find the students that have free periods that fit a given day pattern. Then, for each period in the master schedule, it creates the appropriate number of study hall sections that occur on each day in the day pattern. Assuming the maximum number of students per section is 25, the day pattern MWF would produce study hall sections as follows:Period 1: Two sections each on Monday, Wednesday, and FridayPeriod 2: Zero sectionsPeriod 3: One section each on Monday, Wednesday, and FridayClick Add for each day pattern you want to identify. Click Modify or Delete to edit or remove a day pattern.Note: The default day pattern, if none is entered, is one that reflects all the days in the schedule. In this case only those students who have an unscheduled meeting period that occurs on all days in the schedule will be enrolled in a study hall. For example; if a student is unscheduled during period 3 on both days of an A/B schedule, then the student will be enrolled. If a student is unscheduled during period 3 on only Day A, then the student will not be enrolled in a study hall.""

"# Load Process: Commit the Master Schedule

When you have a satisfactory schedule and want to make it your master schedule for the next school year, you must commit it. Once a schedule is committed, it replaces any existing master schedule and becomes your current schedule.

You can commit the schedule as soon as the current academic year has ended, or you can wait until just before the next academic year begins. If your periods for the next academic year are set up exactly as they are for the current year, you can commit the schedule as soon as you are confident that you no longer need to build or load.

Note: If you use PowerScheduler to create a master schedule, you should commit your master schedule before running the End-of-Year Process. The End-of-Year process modifies each student's Next School Indicator and Next Year Grade. If PowerScheduler is used after running the End-of-Year process, it is likely that students will be scheduled for the wrong school or grade level.

"# Load Process: Load Students

Once you have a satisfactory master schedule, you can begin fine-tuning student schedules by running a load.

Do not load students into your master schedule until you are satisfied with it. Loading will not have any impact on the structure of the schedule, just on the placement of students within it. Also, do not make manual adjustments to student schedules and then reload students; the system will overwrite all of the changes you made.

Note: It is recommended that you run the first load before you define any load constraints."
"# Load Process: Post - Load Options

After completing a load, you can do one or more of the following:

1. Accept the results of the load and begin manually adjusting student schedules. Select this option only if you are positive that the master schedule will not change and that student schedules are correct. Verify student schedules to make sure the master schedule is correct.
2. Resolve student conflicts by using or adding alternate course requests if you did not use them in the first load. If your schedule contains alternate student course requests but you did not allow the system to use them, rerun the load and select the substitutes options.
3. Manually adjust student course requests to allow better scheduling. For example, if a student has a course request that is impossible to meet, change it. Repeat this process until you are satisfied with the results.
4. Select the students you want to reschedule. Then, reload student schedules.



    If you select option 2, 3, or 4 above, you may need to reload student schedules. For more information, see Load Process: Load Students."

"# Load Process: Load Constraints

Load constraints restrict the way the system loads students into courses. Define load constraints before performing a load. To compare results of a load with and without load constraints, first perform a load and then define load constraints.

PowerSchool contains six types of load constraints you can define. Use each one to constrain student schedules in a specific way. For example, use a Student Preference constraint to force a student to be scheduled in a particular teacher's section.

Note: Since constraints restrict student schedules, the more constraints you define, the less flexibility the system has to load students into courses and the less optimal the resulting schedule will be. It is always best to use the fewest number of constraints required to accomplish your scheduling goals.

To view a list of load constraints and the number of each that have been defined for your schedule, choose Load Constraints from the constraints menu.

"# PowerScheduler Load

When to Load Only Student Schedules
-----------------------------------

Complete the PowerScheduler Load Process if you already have a master schedule and only need to load student schedules. It is relevant for schools that meet any of the following criteria:

* Built a master schedule manually
* Copied a previous year's master schedule
* Plan to copy a previous year's master schedule

The process of loading only student schedules includes preparing to load, loading, and committing schedules. This process assumes that you have entered student course requests but not done any other preparation for preparing to build a master schedule.

Because every situation is different, there is some flexibility as to which steps an individual school will need to perform. It is important to understand each step and know how to make adjustments when necessary. Do not perform a step if you are not sure that you should.

The load process includes the following steps:

Auto Scheduler Setup: Must be performed as the first step in the process. Use the Auto Scheduler Setup function to create a scheduling scenario. The scheduling scenario is the basic framework for your schedule before sections and students are added. The scenario includes the terms, periods, days, and courses for the schedule. It is strongly recommended to run the function at every school in the District, regardless of whether each school uses PowerScheduler.

Set Schedule Year: Must be performed as the second step in the process. Use the Set Schedule Year function to associate your scenario with the Years & Terms created using the Auto Scheduler Setup.

Copy Master Schedule: Must be performed as the third step in the process. Use the Copy Master Schedule function to copy the schedule from a previous school year. This function copies sections into the schedule, including all associated settings, such as expression, room, teacher, and term.

Parameters: The following required parameters are set up when using Auto Scheduler Setup: Catalogs, Days, Periods, and Years & Terms.

Load Constraints: Define load constraints, if appropriate.

New Courses: After creating courses, associate them to the course catalog on the live-side, then associate the courses to catalog in PowerScheduler.

Rooms: Create the appropriate rooms for the schedule. Rooms are associated with sections when copying the master schedule. However, you may still need to create them for the current scenario. The master schedule and rooms are directly related; if rooms are not valid, sections will not display in the master schedule.

Teacher Scheduling Preferences: Populate the required teacher scheduling fields, which are Schedule This Teacher and Maximum Consecutive Periods.

Student Scheduling Preferences: Populate the required student scheduling fields, which are Next School, Next Year Grade, and Schedule This Student.

Course Requests: It is necessary to setup new courses and student scheduling preferences before entering student course requests. Student course requests must be entered before loading.

Review Master Schedule: Review the Master Schedule and make any final manual modifications.

Load Validation: Once the schedule is complete and students have entered requests, validate the load. When validating, the PowerScheduler engine performs the load function without actually creating any student schedules. Review any errors or warnings in the Load Results Log.

Load: When a load validation does not return any errors, run a load.

Import Results: To view student schedules in PowerScheduler, it is necessary to import the results. If you are satisfied with the details in the Load Results Log, then import the results to transfer the data into PowerScheduler.

Reports: PowerScheduler includes a group of reports designed for analyzing data after loading.

Re-Load: If you need to make changes that affect student schedules, such as courses, sections, or load constraints, it is possible to run the load again. Re-loading changes all student schedules that were previously imported. To preserve changes, perform the reschedule process.

Manually Schedule: Though PowerScheduler strives to create ideal schedules, it may be necessary to make manual modifications. Re-loading after making manual modifications changes all student schedules. To preserve changes, perform the reschedule process.

Reschedule: To load schedules for a specific group of students, select the group of students and choose the Reschedule the selected \[x\] students option.

Commit the Schedule: Before committing the schedule, verify that there is a current backup of your PowerSchool data. Also, verify that the End-of-Year (EOY) process has not been performed. Then, commit the schedule for the next school year. It is possible to replace student schedules, sections, or both."

"# Calculation Methods
The following table lists the calculation methods available for analyzing assignment standards scores to calculate a final standards grade on a given standard. It also provides information outlining scenarios when using that method may or may not be the best measure for your class. 

```
""Calculation Method"",""When to Use It"",""When Not to Use It""
""Mean"",""When you have equally important scores over time, and the learning is not cumulative. For example, in History, final unit test scores on unit 1, unit 2, and unit 3 may all be independent. In that case, you could use the mean (or average)."",""When students are introduced to a new concept, and the learning is cumulative over time. For example, students initially do not understand a concept, but over the term, they get it. Averaging their initial scores (where they were unfamiliar with the work) with their final attempts (when they understood the concepts) may not be the best measure. For example, consider the following scores: 20%, 30%, 40%, 95%, 100%. In this case, the student likely did not understand the concept initially, but by the end, they got it. The average here is 57%, which may not be the most reflective of their proficiency at the end of the term.""
""Weighted Mean"",""The weighted mean is better than the mean when assignments with high weighted points should be counted more heavily."",""When all standards scores are valid indicators of performance, the teacher may not care about the specific points possible. This is especially true if there are high point value assignments from early in the semester, and the students have grown tremendously since that time.""
""Median"",""When you have multiple data points and students are given lots of chances to demonstrate mastery. It allows the student to overcome their initial attempts when they do not understand initially because only the middle score is used. Some people consider this one of the most consistent measures of performance. This measure throws out high and low outlying scores. For this reason, housing price data is usually listed in terms of the median sales price. There are extremes at either end that can skew the average."",""When there are only a few data points. In that case, the middle number can simply be luck. Or, when the learning is cumulative, where the students know much more at the end of the term, and their proficiency is significantly better across the board than at the start. For example, consider the following scores: 20%, 30%, 40%, 95%, 100%. In this case, the student likely did not understand the concept at the beginning, but by the end they got it. The median (or middle number) here is 40% and may not be the most reflective of their proficiency at the end of the term.""
""Mode"",""When you have a small range of possibilities. For example, when using letter grades A, B, C, D, F, or a 1-4 scale, there is only a limited range of score options. If a student's scores are A, D, A, B, A, the most frequently occurring value is A."",""When there are multiple possible scores, and it is unlikely for the exact score to be consistent. For example, this is not a good measure for percentage scores. Example percentage scores: 90, 91, 25, 100, 99, 81.5, 98, 97, 25, 96, 94. In this data, the mode is 25%. The average is 81.5%. The median is 94%.""
""Highest"",""When the student's highest level of demonstrated proficiency is a good indicator of what they know and can do. When assessments are in-depth and highly reliable. In these cases, many districts believe that the student's highest score is a good indicator."",""When the highest score could be based on chance or lucky guessing. For example, on multiple-choice tests, the student could have guessed right on several questions by chance, boosting their highest score. For example, one student's results for one standard assessed on five multiple-choice tests were as follows: 70, 95, 70, 70, 70. Although the student did get a 95 once, this score may not be the best reflection of the student's actual level of proficiency on this standard.""
""Most Recent"",""When the learning is cumulative and students demonstrate a much higher proficiency level at the end of the term than at the beginning. In these cases, it makes sense to focus on the most recent scores to reflect the student's proficiency."",""When some of the most recent scores themselves are anomalies. For example, if a student recently was very ill, or experienced some other phenomenon, then the most recent scores may not reflect their actual proficiency. This is usually assessed student-by-student to determine if the most recent scores are accurate. It can also happen when the most recent assessment is not as detailed or reliable as earlier assessments, or other distracting factors. For example, students have lots of good quizzes and a unit test with reliable data, followed by in-class review worksheets. Half of the students were distracted completing them because there was construction going on outside. In this case, the most recent data may not be the most reflective.""

"# Custom Reports

Use PowerSchool to set up reusable report templates according to your individual needs. The resulting reports provide you with customized views of the information stored in PowerSchool. Print, save, or use the reports as view-only tools. As the data stored on the system changes regularly, the report results will likely change every time you run a new report, even if you use the same template.

Custom reports are different from preconfigured reports because you decide what information to include in the final report and how it will look.

While all reports can be run for all students, some can be run for a selected group of students. If the report you choose allows this option, select the group of students and click the PowerSchool logo to return to the start page. PowerSchool remembers the group while you are signed in and will allow you to select the group as you build the report template.

There are four styles of PowerSchool custom reports: report cards, mailing labels, form letters, and object reports. Each can be created to meet your needs, and all four styles can be saved as templates for reuse.

If a report is no longer useful, you can inactivate it. When editing a custom report, mark the report as Inactive to inactivate the report, move it to the Inactive section, and prevent it from being printed. You can reactive inactive reports by editing the report and clearing the Inactive option. For more information about report templates, see Report Templates. For more information about other ways to create reports, see Report Formatting."

"# Enterprise Reporting

PowerSchool Enterprise Reporting is a feature set within PowerSchool that allows users to access pre-built and ad hoc reports created using Oracle Application Express (APEX). From within the reporting area of PowerSchool users may access Enterprise Reports within report categories and access may be controlled using User Access Roles. Roles must be set and Enterprise Reporting categories assigned to those roles for any Enterprise Reports to be available within PowerSchool. Please note that the reports delivered are for example purposes only and may need specific modification within the APEX Builder in order to work for your district or school.

In addition, administrative users will be able to control access to the APEX application outside of PowerSchool in order to create and share more Enterprise Reports within PowerSchool. Please note that there may be performance impacts when running these reports and data security should be considered when providing access to and distributing Enterprise Reports."
"# Work with Oracle Application Express
On this page:

Within APEX, the Application Builder module provides access to the pre-built Enterprise Reports delivered with PowerSchool, as well as the functionality to edit these reports and create new ones. Two pre-built applications are available within the Application Builder:

* Application 100, PowerSchool Enterprise Reporting, is reserved for you to save modified Interactive Reports and to create new ones.
* Application 200, PowerSchool Enterprise Reporting, is reserved for PowerSchool pre-built Interactive Reports now and going forward.

Note: All reports created or modified during the preview release of Enterprise Reporting should be imported back into Application 100, PowerSchool Enterprise Reporting.

Note: Only interactive reports created in APEX may be published to PowerSchool as Enterprise Reports. Websheet Applications, Forms, and other pages created in APEX may require read/write access, are not supported, and may not be published in PowerSchool.

In addition, all interactive reports to be published as Enterprise Reports within PowerSchool must use PS\_APEX and not PS or any other Schema. PS\_APEX provides secure access to PowerSchool data. Reports created using other schema will not be allowed to run from PowerSchool.

APEX is a full featured development environment. In order to learn more about APEX and how to create additional interactive reports that may be published to PowerSchool as Enterprise Reports, see Oracle Application Express Documentation Release 5.0, which contains several important user guides including, the Application Express Application Builder User's Guide, the Application Express SQL Workshop Guide, and the Application Express End User's Guide."
"# Access Oracle Application Express (APEX)
To access APEX, you must navigate to a specific URL outside of PowerSchool. In the preview release, APEX could be accessed using the URL http://(serveraddress)/ords. In order to better manage performance, Enterprise Reporting is now running on the same application server as ReportWorks. A port number has been added to the URL. APEX can now be accessed using the URL http://(serveraddress):8443/ords. If you are self-hosted, this port number may change based on how you have ReportWorks set up in your local environment.

1. Enter http://(serveraddress):8443/ords\* in your browser's \*Address field. The Oracle Application Express sign in page appears.

FLS is supported within Enterprise Reporting at the column level within interactive reports that are published to PowerSchool as Enterprise Reports. This means that in order to implement FLS in an Enterprise Report users must add the needed code to each column in an APEX interactive report. All of the example Enterprise Reports provided in the preview and current release have FLS implemented at the column level. Specifically, a PL/SQL Expression shown below needs to be added as a Condition for each column:

CAS\_GET\_FIELD\_SECURITY('LASTFIRST','STUDENTS',:P101\_CURRENT\_USERID,:P101\_CURRENT\_SCHOOLID)

For more information on adding conditions at the column level to interactive reports in APEX, see the Conditions Available in Application Builder section in the Application Express Application Builder User's Guide."
"# Back Up Enterprise Reports
Interactive reports created or modified within APEX are not automatically backed up with your PowerSchool data. You should be sure to periodically back up all of your interactive reports. Any reports that you create or modify must be exported and then re-imported in order to restore them. For detailed information about how to export APEX reports, see the Exporting an Application and Application Components section in the Application Express Application Builder User's Guide. For detailed information about how to import exported APEX reports, see the Importing Export Files section in the Application Express Application Builder User's Guide."

To create an object, click the type of object you want to create. For more information, see Objects on an Object Report."
"# Objects on an Object Report
On this page:

You can create many types of objects to include on an object report: text objects, line objects, box objects, circle objects, transcript objects, standards objects, fee list objects, picture objects, and sequence objects. You can create multiple objects on each object report and create the objects in any order. However, it is ideal for the objects to be listed on the Object Report page in order from top to bottom and from left to right. For example, give a logo placed in the upper-left corner of the report the label of ""A Logo,"" then give a horizontal line placed in the middle of the page the label ""B line."" In this example, the picture object for the logo would be listed first, followed by the line object.

To enhance the appearance of the object report, you can format many objects. Prior to adding objects to an object report, you must first create set up the object report parameters. For more information about creating a new object report or editing an existing object report, see Object Reports.

When you create an object, you define where you want it to appear on a page and on which page of the report you want it to appear. To do this, define the coordinates of each object you create in inches on an X (horizontal) and Y (vertical) axis. You can use a ruler and a piece of paper to determine the coordinates of each object you create.

Use the Print Reports option on the Group Functions page to print a custom report for the selected students. For information about creating reports, see Custom Reports. For information about printing an object report or any type of report, see Run, Print, and Save Reports."
"# Text Objects
Text objects are boxes that contain text. Specify if you want the box to be framed or unframed. Within a text object, you can include two types of text:

* Constant text, such as a title (for example, Official Transcript). The same title appears for all students.
* Variable text, such as PowerSchool field names or codes (for example, mailing\_address). Different information appears for different students.

For example, you can include the constant text Name: just before variable text first\_name and last\_name fields."

7. Click Submit to save the text object. If the text object does not print correctly, edit it by clicking the object name on the Object Report page and repeating the procedure. 
    Note: For example, assume a student does not have a Social Security number. By default, the text box prints one blank space, then prints the birth date text directly next to it (SS# BIRTH DATE: 9/2/1984). If this causes alignment concerns in your text box, you can use the <TABTO (inches)> HTML tag in your text object. Within the tag, before the text you want to print in a specific space, enter the number of inches from the left margin that you want to print the text. For example, if a student does not have a Social Security number, but you still want the birth date to print 2.25 inches from the left margin, you can enter: SS# ^(ssn)<TABTO 2.25>^BIRTH DATE: ^(dob)."
"# Line Objects
Create line objects to include horizontal and vertical lines on your object report. Lines can separate information and make it easier to read. For each line you create, you define the location, thickness, and number of times it appears.

Define line objects as if they were printing on a graph. For each line, you define the X and Y coordinates in inches. The X coordinate is the horizontal point from the left margin at which you want the line to print. The Y coordinate is the vertical point from the top margin at which you want the line to print.

"# Object Reports With Test Tags
Use test tags to include student test results in outputs. An output is a PDF file (such as an object report), an export, or an HTML page. For example, use the test tag when creating an object report text object. Enter the appropriate tags and supporting text in the Text field.

Test tags typically include several parameters to limit and format what appears on the report. For example, use the following test tag on a progress report to display a student's midterm test score:

~(tests;name=midterm;score=total;which=current)

You can also use the test tag inside an IF tag, which is a tag used to evaluate a given condition. For example, use an IF tag to display the statement ""This student may wish to retake the ACT"" on students' Graduation Progress pages if they earn ACT composite scores of less than 25.

In addition, you can add formats to the result of the test tag. The following is an example of a test tag that includes a type value, result value, and format string:

~(tests;name=ACT;score=math;which=last;type=num;result=value;format=##0.00)

The first three parameters refine the selection, and the next three parameters determine its presentation. If a student's last math ACT score was 23.14285, the result would be 23.14.

See the following table for parameter information.

```
""Parameter"",""Examples"",""Notes""
""NAME"",""ACTSAT"",""No default.Note: NAME and SCORE are dependent upon tests defined on your PowerSchool system.""
""SCORE"",""MATHENGLISHSCIENCECOMPOSITE"",""No default.""

""TYPE"",""NUMPERCENTALPHA"",""The default is NUM.""
""RESULT"",""VALUESUMAVGDATECOUNTMINMAX"",""The default is SUM.""
""FORMAT"",""[Format string]"",""""
```

Some parameters are not compatible with others. For example, you cannot have a RESULT of SUM with a TYPE of ALPHA. Various combinations are detailed in the table below.

For example, the WHICH parameter TERM.CURRENT includes multiple tests. The RESULT parameter could meaningfully be set to SUM, AVG, COUNT, MIN, and MAX. A RESULT parameter of VALUE would not be meaningful and would return nothing.

See the following table to determine parameter compatibility; X indicates valid usage.

"# Object Reports

Use object reports to create and print official school reports and documents such as transcripts (traditional grades and standards grades), scheduling forms, report cards, letters, and award certificates for students.

These reports are called object reports because you can insert objects such as boxes, lines, circles, logos, and pictures into them. When you create each object, you determine where it appears on the report in relation to the other objects. These objects appear on the electronic or paper output according to the specifications you enter on each object's setup page. The best way to generate an object report is to create a few objects and print a sample to ensure that it looks as it should. For more information, see Objects on an Object Report.

Use object reports to display information related to standards and tests. For more information, see Object Reports With Standards Grades and Object Reports with Test Tags, respectively.

When creating custom report—especially object reports—it is a good idea to preview them frequently as you work. Therefore, before creating any new reports, open a preview page. You can preview and print any type of custom report from the Print Reports page.

Note: Reports created using the Log table are only accessible by clicking Print a Report on the Log Entry Functions page. For more information, see Report on Log Entries.

For reports pertaining to a group of students, select a group of students and click the Select Function arrow and choose Print Reports from Group Functions pop-up menu. For more information, see Open a Preview Page.

Localizing Object Reports
-------------------------

* When generating an object report, the selected locale specifies only the Data Access Tags (DATs) used in the report. The report developer must enter the report title and any body text in the applicable language.

"# Monthly Student Attendance Report
Use the Monthly Student Attendance report to display attendance per student per day, including holidays. This report displays the days the student was not enrolled, absent, or in attendance. The days in session and carry forward, gains, losses, and ending enrollment appear at the end of the report.

By default, the codes and values included in the report represent full days of absences and attendance even if the school is set up with attendance conversions that count partial absences and attendance. When attendance is calculated using the Attendance Conversions (defined in School Setup > Attendance Conversions), it is possible to get an attendance value of, for example, 1.5 for a 2-day period, meaning they were absent half a day in those two day periods. But the Monthly Student Attendance report does not report a 1.5 attendance. It reports 2 full days of attendance and 0 absences. It does not count half-day absences.

To include codes and values for partial day absences and attendance, select the Include Partial Attendance checkbox before submitting.

The report adjusts to reflect Clock In/Clock Out values if used when recording attendance."

"# Attendance Reports

Before producing attendance reports, you are encouraged to ask your PowerSchool administrator how your school calculates attendance. For example, does your school report how many days students are present or how many days they are absent? While you can run all attendance reports for individual students, you can also run many for a selected group of students. If an attendance report allows group reporting, select that group of students before running the report. If you select a group of students from the start page, the Group Functions page appears either immediately or after selecting students from the Student Selection page.

"# Membership Reports
On this page:

The membership reports use daily attendance to generate average daily attendance and average daily membership numbers that depend on the number of days a student has attended. These reports can be run in either Meeting or Daily mode.

Depending on the mode, there are two conversions that can be applied to the report. For Meeting mode, select either ""Period to Day"" or ""Time to Day"" attendance conversion. The ""Period to Day"" option uses the Period Items conversion, and the ""Time to Day"" option uses the Time Items conversion. For Daily mode, select either ""Code to Day"" or ""Time to Day"" attendance conversion. The ""Code to Day"" option uses the Code Items conversion, and the ""Time to Day"" option uses the Time Items conversion. For more information, see Attendance Conversions.

The reports adjust to reflect Time In and Time Out values if used when recording attendance.

To perform a membership audit by section, see Run the Aggregate Membership Audit Report."

"# ADM/ADA by Student Report
The ADM/ADA by Student report generates membership and attendance information per student. This report uses the attendance codes or minutes entered into PowerSchool. The report then sums the total membership and attendance for each student for the given timeframe, with a final average for the number of students having membership and attending for a given date range.

To avoid slow processing time while running the ADA/ADM by Student report, please check the following:

* If the reporting date range spans the entire year, try running the report for a smaller date range.
* Check the selected grade levels when running this report. Instead of running the report for all grade levels, run the report only for those grade levels you would like to report on.
* If you intend to run the report for a selection of students, ensure prior to executing the report that your report parameters are set to run for the current selection instead of all students.
* When starting the report, choose to run the report ASAP instead of in the background.
* Check the reporting queue for other jobs that are currently running. When multiple reporting jobs are running, all reports may run slower. Run the ADA/ADM by Student report when fewer users are processing reports.
* Check the report queue for reports that are not responding. Often, these reports can prevent any other report from completing.

PowerSchool includes a number of preconfigured system reports that allow you to start analyzing data right away. System reports contain information that PowerSchool administrators need most often and include parameters, which you can use to filter and sort the data displayed on these reports.

For details on all system reports, see Attendance Reports, Attendance Count and Audit Reports, Discipline Reports, Grade and Gradebook Reports, Membership Reports, Enrollment Reports, Scheduling, Parent/Student Access Statistics, and Student Listings. You are also encouraged to see the section Custom Reports before creating a report to give you an understanding of the process of creating reports, which will make running reports much easier.

While you can run all reports on individual students, you can also run many for a selected group of students. If a report allows group reporting, first select the group of students. For more information, see Select a Group of Students. Click the PowerSchool logo to return to the start page and begin work on a report. PowerSchool remembers the group and prompts you to select it when you enter the report parameters."
"# Report Formatting
On this page:

Many PowerSchool reports are generated in your Web browser application and are formatted for you. However, some reports require formatting before PowerSchool can generate them. Modifiable parameters include header and footer text, margin size, font, line height, and grid lines. In many cases, you do not have to make any changes to the default values that appear when you open a new template. However, you have the option of changing the format of certain reports.

When report formats can be altered, you have the option of changing some or all of the settings. When you change a setting, it becomes the default for anyone who uses the report unless you change it back. Note that not all of the settings appear on every report, and that the following list is not all-inclusive.

The following table describes each function:

```
""Item"",""Description""
""Margins"",""This is the space at the top, bottom, and sides of the report. Margins are set in inches.""
""Font"",""This is the text style. Choose the font from the pop-up menu.""
""Font Size"",""This is the size of the letters. It is set in points (72 points = 1 inch).""
""Frame"",""This is the border of a report.""
""Justification/Alignment"",""This refers to how the text or listings are lined up horizontally on the page:Left justification means that all lines start from the specified point on the left side of the page with each line ending at a different point on the right (depending on the number of characters in each line).Right justification means that all lines start from the specified point on the right side of the page with each line ending at a different point on the left (depending on the number of characters in each line).Centered justification means that each line is centered on the page, making the left (beginning) and right (ending) points different for each line.Full justification means that all lines begin at a specified point on the left side of the page and end at a specified point on the right side of the page; spacing is adjusted between words and letters of words to accommodate this setting.""
""Line/Text Height"",""This is the height of a line of data. It is set in points (72 points = 1 inch).""
""Line/Frame Width"",""This is the thickness of a line or the lines making up the frame. It is set in points (72 points = 1 inch).""
""Rule Thickness"",""This is the thickness of the grid lines on a roster. It is set in inches.""
""Gutter Width"",""This is the distance between reports when more than one is printed on a page. It is set in columns and rows.""
""Padding"",""This is the amount of space around the text. It is set in inches and can be horizontal or vertical spacing.""
""Rounding"",""This refers to how square or rounded the corners of the frame are. The higher the number, the rounder the corner.""
""Where to Start Listing (X,Y)"",""This indicates the place on the page where the report is located. X is the distance from the left side of the page; Y is the distance from the top of the page. It is set in inches.""
""Horizontal Offset"",""This refers to the amount of space between X,Y points (see above) and the start of the listings. It is set in inches.""
""Horizontal/Vertical Change"",""This is the amount of horizontal or vertical space between line objects in an object report. It is set in inches.""
""Schedule Listings"",""These are the columns of data to be included on the report. Usually one column represents one PowerSchool data field.""
""Orientation"",""This is the page layout. Portrait is a vertical page; landscape is a horizontal page.""
""Reduction"",""This refers to the finished size of the report. Fit more on a page by reducing it by a percentage, but remember to leave it as large as possible for easier viewing. Reduction is also known as scale.""

3. Choose File > Save As from the menu.
4. Enter a file name for the report. If you think you will forget it, write it down.
5. Click Save. The report is saved. Open it using a procedure similar to opening a document in a word processing or spreadsheet application."
"# Alternate Ways to Create Reports
There are some shortcuts to creating a report from scratch. One way is to use a report template that someone else has already created. The second way is to copy a template that is already on your PowerSchool system. The third way is to create a template in a word processing application and paste it into a PowerSchool template.# Use a Template From Another PowerSchool System
There are two parts to using an existing template. First, download (or export) it from a PowerSchool system. Then, import it to a second PowerSchool system for the person who wants to use it. This process is just like copying a document from one hard drive to your own. The only difference is that you are copying a report template from one PowerSchool system to another. For more information, see Report Templates."
"# Copy a Template From Your PowerSchool System
Use the procedures discussed in the section Report Templates to copy a template on your own PowerSchool system and import it back to the same PowerSchool system. This is helpful when you need a report similar to an existing one with only minor changes. Be sure to give the template a different name so that you do not end up with two templates of the same name. Once the template is in PowerSchool, edit the parameters to create a new one. This is similar to using the Save As option in many applications. Open an existing document and save it under a different name to save it as two documents. Keep the one in its original format and edit the other.# Create a Template in Another Application
This method can be helpful if you do not feel comfortable working outside of a word processing application. You can create the template in an application you know with minimal time spent entering HTML tags and PowerSchool data codes. The idea is to create the template using a word processing application and then paste it into a PowerSchool template, while replacing the appropriate sections with some HTML tags and PowerSchool data codes. To create PowerSchool templates, create and save Report Cards, Mailing Labels, Form Letters, and Object Reports to reuse as templates."
"# Report Structure

On this page:

Knowing how a report is structured will help you understand how to set up a report. All parts of a report are not used in every report, but you should know what each part does. In most cases, you decide which parts to include on the final report.

Report Listings
---------------

PowerSchool pulls this report data according to your specifications. Report listings are also known as schedule listings.

Title
-----

This title appears at the top of the final report. It should be descriptive but brief.

Header
------

This information appears above the report listings. It can be an opening to a letter or a description of the data to follow.

Footer
------

This information appears below the report listings. It can be a closure to the report or instructions on how to proceed.

Body/Statement
--------------

This text appears on the report. It can be placed above or below the report listings.

Database Extensions
-------------------

Any database extensions created in PowerSchool are available to use on reports. For more information, see Database Extensions.

HTML Tags
---------

HTML stands for hypertext mark-up language, which is most often used to create Web pages. Because PowerSchool is a Web-based system, some HTML is also used to format PowerSchool reports. HTML tags give special characteristics to text in your reports. You can employ HTML tags in a PowerSchool report to center, bold, or italicize text. The following are a few examples of commonly used HTML tags:

* <b> = bold text
* <br> = inserts a line break
* <p> = paragraph break; inserts a space between reports

PowerSchool Data Codes
----------------------

PowerSchool data codes insert data into reports through a merge process similar to that used in word processing applications. You use the data codes to tell PowerSchool what fields you want in the report. PowerSchool pulls the data from those fields for the selected student or group and inserts that data into the report. While HTML tags are programming codes, PowerSchool data codes are specific to PowerSchool and are used to merge data from the PowerSchool database. The following are some common PowerSchool data codes:

* ^(\*credit\_hours) = number of cumulative credit hours the student has earned
* ^(\*gpa;Q3) = student's GPA for third quarter
* ^(grade\_level) = student's grade level
* ^(He/She) = correct pronoun for each student based on the Gender field
* ^(he/she) = correct pronoun for each student based on the Gender field
* ^(him/her) = correct pronoun for each student based on the Gender field
* ^(His/Her) = correct pronoun for each student based on the Gender field
* ^(his/her) = correct pronoun for each student based on the Gender field
* ^(lastfirst) = student's last name, first name
* ^(schoolname) = name of the school
* ^(son/daughter) = correct pronoun for each student based on the Gender field
* ^(yearname) = school year
* ^\[time\] = prints the current time


Note: The asterisk (\*) is used to indicate that data must be calculated.

For more information about data codes, see PowerSource."

"# Scheduling

This section provides comprehensive information about the configuration and administration of the PowerSchool application functions and components associated with scheduling."
"# Constraints
On this page:

The School Setup menu includes a Scheduling link, Constraints. Click the Constraints link to access the Constraints page, which you can use to define scheduling constraints for students. Load constraints restrict the way the system loads students into courses that have already been scheduled.

This information is either captured as part of the PowerScheduler commit process or can be manually defined (added, edited, deleted) using these pages. In the past, this information was strictly defined within the context of mass scheduling within PowerScheduler.

Note: Since constraints restrict student schedules, the more constraints you define, the less flexibility the system has to load students into courses and the less optimal the resulting schedule will be. It is always best to use the fewest number of constraints required to accomplish your scheduling goals."

"# Course Numbers

Using the Change Course Number function, you can change the number of an existing course in your course list to another number in your course list. The course list is the list of courses available to all schools on your PowerSchool system. When changing a course number, the system updates that number in courses, enrollments, sections, and historical data.

For example, assume two high schools on your server offer U.S. History. The course number for U.S. History at School A is 1000; at School B, it is 2000. Assume your district decides that the two schools should share the same course number. You need to change the course number for U.S. History at both schools to 1200.

First, you must create the new course, 1200. Then, change both course 1000 and 2000 to 1200, using the Change Course Number function.

Before changing a course number for a particular school, use the navigation bar at the top of the page to be sure you are working in the school in which you want to change the course number. If you are changing a course number for all schools on your system, it does not matter which school is currently selected.

Prerequisites
-------------

* Import the data from both schools.

* Create a new course with a unique course number for one school's courses.


Change a Course Number
----------------------

Before changing a course number, retrieve the existing course number from the course list. For more information, see View the Course List.

1. On the start page, choose System under Setup in the main menu. 
2. Under Data Management, click Change Course Number. 
3. Use the following table to enter information in the fields:

"# Relationships
The scheduling engine uses course relationships when building a student's schedule. If you define a relationship for a course with another course, you do not have to define the relationship for both courses. But, you can define the relationship for both courses so that it is easy to identify this relationship regardless of which course you are viewing. The following three types of course relationships are used in PowerSchool:

* Prerequisite: Indicates the relationship between two courses ensures that the student will be scheduled into the specified course so that the course is completed before the beginning of the second course.
* Corequisite: Indicates the relationship between two courses ensures that the student will be scheduled into both courses so that the courses are taken concurrently.
* Postrequisite: Indicates the relationship between two courses ensures that the student will be scheduled into the specified course after the student has completed the first course in the relationship.

Use graduation sets to track student graduation progress. Graduation sets are sets of course requirements for which students must earn a specified number of credits. For example, you can create a graduation set for this year's incoming ninth-graders.

Within a graduation set, create different subject area requirements, such as Science, Math, and English. Within each subject area requirement, define the number of credits students must earn to fulfill that requirement. 

Monitor students' progress towards earning the credits they need to complete a predefined set of requirements for graduation from your school or entrance to a higher education institution. For more information, see Graduation Progress.

Add a Graduation Set

"# Periods

On this page:


Use this page to view the list of periods already created for your school. Periods are set on the Years and Terms page. For more information, see Years and Terms. Here, you can edit period names and abbreviations.

Note: Each school on your PowerSchool system creates and maintains its own list of class periods.

Periods are used in combination with days to create schedule expressions. For example, a section of Biology that meets for the first period on each day of a two-day schedule has the expression 1(A-B). Periods are also part of what is defined as a section meeting. That section of Biology has two meetings, which are noted as 1(A) and 1(B). When running reports or viewing schedules, you can often filter by periods and/or days. Before displaying the results, however, your selections are validated against your school's bell schedule and calendar to determine if the period is valid for the selected date or date range.

"# Sections
On this page:


A section is an occurrence of a course. Each course can have several sections that meet in different rooms at different times and are taught by different teachers. You can review and manage course sections from the School Setup page.

For example, a school has a chemistry course; however, because there are too many students for one class, there are several sections of chemistry. Two different teachers instruct it for four different periods each. Thus, the school has eight sections of chemistry. Each section has a different number, usually preceded by the same course number to indicate that it is part of the same chemistry course.

Each section has an associated schedule expression, which is the combination of periods and days in which this section is taught. For example, a section of Biology meets during fifth and sixth period on A and B days. The schedule expression 5-6(A-B) displays on the Edit Section page."

When you delete a course section, all enrollment records associated with that section also are deleted. Therefore, you need to know the password to delete a course section.

Sections cannot be deleted if the current year contains one or more student sections (enrollments) with attendance records. If one or more students with attendance records are enrolled in a section being deleted, an error message displays and you must reset the attendance for each student enrolled in the section. If a section is successfully deleted (no orphan attendance is found), PowerSchool generates a query to find any attendance associated with the section. If attendance records are found, they are deleted. To modify attendance, refer to Meeting/Interval Attendance.

1. Navigate to the \[course name\] page or the Teacher Schedule \[Teacher\] page. For more information, refer to Navigate to and Work with Sections.
2. Click the section number in the Sec# columns. 
3. Click Delete Section.
4. Enter the required password in the Password field. 
    Note: Your school's PowerSchool administrator can set this password. 

5. Click Confirm Delete."
"# Assign Teachers to a Section
Teachers are assigned to a section on the Edit Section page. The PowerSchool administrator can add multiple section lead and additional staff/teachers to a section. The teacher-of-record is the section lead teacher, and other staff/teachers are the additional teachers.

A lead teacher must be designated for every day the section's term. Multiple lead teachers can be added for different days of the term, but no more than one teacher can be the lead teacher on any given day. This is done to keep a single teacher-of-record for every day the section meets, in order to remain compatible with systems that only allow for one teacher per section.

Note that ""% Allocation"" is only used for reporting purposes. It is not necessary to have allocation totals reach 100 percent, nor is it necessary to keep them below 100 percent. 
For example: 

```
""Staff"",""Role"",""% Allocation"",""Start Date"",""End Date""
""Staff"",""Lead Teacher"",""100"",""9/1/12"",""12/1/12""
""Role"",""Lead Teacher"",""100"",""12/2/12"",""3/1/13""
""% Allocation"",""Co-Teacher"",""50"",""12/2/12"",""3/1/13""
```

Teacher start and end dates can never be set before or after the dates of a sections term. If the term changes to one that causes the dates to be out of range, (i.e. From Q1 to Q2), a notice will display stating that the dates had to be adjusted.

When changing a term, both the section lead and additional teacher association dates are mapped to the new term dates. Additionally, any gaps or overlaps are adjusted for Lead Teachers.# Assign a Section Lead Teacher

"# Teacher Maximum Load
On this page:


Use the Teacher Maximum Load function to prevent teachers from being scheduled to teach more students in a day than is allowed by their contracts. Activate the Teacher Maximum Load function at the district level and give each teacher who has a maximum load a value of the number of students they can teach in a day. To activate this function, see Set Up Miscellaneous District Settings. To specify a maximum load per teacher, see Staff Scheduling Preferences.

For sections to count towards a teacher's daily maximum load, you must modify the section to not be exempt from the maximum load calculation. Since you may not want some classes (such as supervised study hall) to count towards a teacher's maximum load, you can set sections as exempt from the maximum load calculation. To set a section's load status, see Sections.

When specifying a teacher's maximum load, the number must be a numeric integer representing the total number of students that a teacher can be scheduled for on any given day. Also, the aggregation of the number of students scheduled for a teacher is be based on seats scheduled; that is, if a student is scheduled into more than one of that teacher's classes, then the student is counted as many times as they are scheduled in that teacher's classes.

There are two ways to report on teacher maximum load information. One reports on the sections' maximum enrollment and the teachers' maximum student load for the term in which the specified date is included. However, since a section may have added or dropped enrollments, the report displays aggregated numbers for the maximum load. For more information, see Run the Teacher Maximum Load Report. The other recalculates the teacher maximum load and displays each enrollment violation for the current date. For more information, see Calculate Teacher Maximum Load."
"# Calculate Teacher Maximum Load
Use this function to display load violations and to refresh the maximum load information by recalculating teachers' maximum load information. Events that require recalculations include:

* When modifying the school calendar: changing a lettered day (such as making an A day a B day), marking a day as ""in session,"" or switching bell schedules
* When modifying a section: changing the expression \[such as from 1(A) to 1(B)\], changing the maximum load status to or from Exempt, or changing the assigned teacher
* When changing a teacher's maximum load, specifically to a lower number

Note: Using USM to modify the course records (CC) table invalidates the daily count for the affected teacher, thereby circumventing the preventative controls of Teacher Maximum Load function. Also, running the special operation ""Recover from mass transfer out"" also invalidates the maximum load count. After performing either of these activities, perform the Teacher Maximum Load Setup function to recalculate and report violations of load counts.

1. On the start page, choose System under Setup in the main menu. 
2. Under Scheduling, click Teacher Maximum Load Setup. 
3. Select a teacher or select All Teachers from the Select a Teacher pop-up menu.
4. Click Submit. After calculating and updating the daily load counts for the selected teacher(s), the report lists any load violations. If no violations exist, the message ""No violations found"" appears.# Years and Terms
Define years and terms for your school. Years and terms affect many aspects of PowerSchool, such as the calendar setup, scheduling, enrollment, and final grades.

First, create the year term for your school. Then, define additional terms for the school year, if necessary.

Terms created on the Years & Terms page are ""scheduling terms,"" which define the entire length of a school year (year term) as well as the length of sections offered during the school year (semester, quarter, etc.). Classes offered during the school year determine the required scheduling terms. If students have the same teacher, room, and section throughout the year, only the year term is needed. However, if students change teachers, rooms, or sections throughout the year, create additional terms of varying lengths (semester, quarter, etc.).

Note: Scheduling terms differ from ""grading terms."" For information about defining grading terms, see Final Grade Setup."

"# Course Requests and Schedule
On this page:

In PowerSchool, you create and maintain a primary class schedule for each student in your school. Throughout the year, you might need to make schedule changes for existing students, or create new schedules for students who enroll at your school during the year. There are two ways to maintain student schedules: manual scheduling and auto-scheduling. Manual scheduling is section-specific and allows you to pick specific sections in which to enroll the student, overriding the system-defined schedule if one exists. Auto scheduling is course-specific. You enter a student's request for specific courses. The system then automatically schedules the student for the sections that best fit their schedule.

Maintaining student schedules can be done in conjunction with Scheduler or independently."

"# Modify a Student's Schedule Using Automated Walk-In
With Automated Walk-In Scheduling, you no longer need to manually create schedules for students who have enrolled in school after the initial scheduling process has been completed. Instead, you can leverage the existing scheduling engine, which determines the most optimal schedule for the student automatically.

In a typical scenario for a school during the first week of a new school year, many students either do not have a schedule or need to revise their previously-created schedule. These students are sent to a counselor who often has many other students waiting to work on their schedule. It can be very frustrating for the counselor to have to manually find open sections in the master course schedule and try to create a schedule that works best for the student.

With Automated Walk-In Scheduling, PowerSchool automatically determines the most optimal schedule for the student while considering the many rules and constraints concerning the student and schedule, such as load constraints, course relationships, enrollment constraints, and section types. Additionally, you can select to schedule by team, house, or building. All this can be done while locking existing section enrollments to preserve those records yet schedule additional requests. Counselors then choose to accept or reject the schedule returned by the engine before it is made permanent.

The following functional flow describes the basic course of events to perform to successfully create a new schedule for an individual student or modify an existing schedule for an individual student within PowerSchool.

1. On the start page, search for and select a student.
2. Under Scheduling, choose Modify Schedule from the student pages menu.
3. Enter the date the enrollment becomes effective. The default is set to today's date. 
    Note: If any attendance records for the student exist before the new entry date or after the new exit date, an error message will appear. To modify attendance, see Meeting/Interval Attendance. 

4. Before continuing, you can lock or drop students' section enrollments. 
5. Click Requests. 

    Note: To reference the course catalog for the selected scheduling year, click Course Catalog. For more information, Reference the Course Catalog.

6. Click New.

7. Click Associate to select the name of the course. The Associate Course page appears. Press and hold COMMAND (Mac) or CONTROL (Windows) to make multiple selections. When done selecting courses, click Okay.
8. Click Submit. 
9. Modify the requests by identifying which ones are alternate requests and assigning priorities or associating one alternate course with the primary requests.
10. Click Submit.
11. Click Enrollments. 
12. Click Automated Schedule. The information is exported to the scheduling engine. The scheduling engine creates the most optimal schedule for the student based on the student's course requests, load constraints, course relationships, and applicable scheduling parameters. The results are then imported from the scheduling engine. 
    The page displays any error messages, enrollments, and course requests. At this point, the results have not become a permanent schedule for the student. The results can only be accepted or rejected in whole. 
    Note: You can always modify the schedule by dropping and adding enrollments via the Modify Schedule page. 


13. Do one of the following:
    * If the results are unacceptable, click Discard to clear the results. The Modify Schedule - Enrollments page displays the original schedule.
    * If the results are acceptable, click Accept. The Modify Schedule - Enrollments page displays the new schedule."

Suppose you work at a high school that includes grades 9 through 12. In order to include the eighth-graders, who will be ninth-graders in the fall, change their next school to your school. To exclude the twelfth graders, change their next school to Graduated students.

Note: Don't forget to set the Next School Indicator field for students who are continuing at your school next year.

"# Search the In-App Help

The PowerSchool in-app help provides access to help topics and release notes in a searchable space.

You can find information in two ways:

* To search all content available in your online documentation space, enter a word or phrase in the Search field; all pages that contain your search word or phrase appear in the search results.
* To search within a single page, use your browser's search function.

Supported Searches
------------------

The in-app help Search field supports several ways to search for information.

### Match Phrase

To find content that contains a specific phrase, use double quotes ("" "") to search for content that contains a phrase, for example, ""temporary password "".

### OR

Use the operator 'OR' to find content that contains only one of the words you enter. Enter OR between the words you want to find ('OR' must be in capital letters); for example, entering parent OR account returns content that contains either the word parent or the word account, providing more results than the Phrase search or the AND search.

### AND

The 'AND' search is useful when you want to find content that contains all the words you have entered, but the words are not a phrase. To use the 'AND' Search, enter the operator 'AND' in capital letters between each word. For example, parent AND account. The resulting pages contain all the words in the content (but not necessarily together, as in the Phrase search).

### NOT

Use the 'NOT' search to find content that contains one word but not the other. Enter the operator 'NOT' in capital letters between each word. For example, to find content with the word parent but not the word account, in the Search field, you would enter parent NOT account.

### Wildcards

Wildcards replace one or more characters in your search. Use a question mark ( ? ) to replace a single character or an asterisk ( \* ) to replace multiple characters in your search. For example, print\* finds content containing 'printer' or 'printing', while b?tter finds content containing 'butter' or 'better'. Wildcards cannot be used at the beginning of a word."
"# LDAP Setup

In order for PowerSchool to authenticate users using an LDAP directory server, the LDAP directory server must be configured within PowerSchool.

Configuring the LDAP directory server consists of providing the server's address, port, SSL setting, and LDAP directory administrator credentials. It is possible to selectively enable or disable the use of LDAP for three groups of users: staff, teachers, and students. Each group of users enabled for LDAP must also have a domain context configured that identifies the root of the tree where each group of user accounts is located along with the name of the user ID attribute from the directory schema.

Once configured, the LDAP directory server synchronizes the usernames stored in PowerSchool's database with the sign in (user) IDs stored in your LDAP directory server.

To get started, configure the following setup items in the order by which they appear:

* Synchronization and Authentication
* Set Up the LDAP Directory
* Synchronize Using LDAP Directory Synchronization
* Perform Staff LDAP Directory Synchronization
* Perform Student LDAP Directory Synchronization"

"# Synchronization and Authentication

Directory synchronization is the process of synchronizing the usernames stored in PowerSchool's database with the sign in (user) IDs stored in your LDAP directory. For a user to successfully authenticate in PowerSchool via LDAP, the usernames must match in both PowerSchool and the LDAP Directory.

When LDAP is enabled, usernames are no longer directly editable through the PowerSchool user interface on either the Modify Info for Students or Security Settings for Teachers and Staff pages. Instead, you must use one of the Synchronization processes.

Synchronization can either be performed as a mass operation, using a selection of students or teachers and staff, or one at a time using the LDAP Lookup button on either the Modify Information or Security Settings pages."
"# Synchronize Using LDAP Directory Synchronization

Use the LDAP Directory Synchronization page to synchronize PowerSchool Usernames with an LDAP directory server.

1. On the start page, choose System under Setup in the main menu.
2. Under Security, click LDAP Directory Synchronization. 
    The LDAP Directory Synchronization page acts as a hub for all of the synchronization processes. From this page, you can choose to synchronize the current selection of students or teachers and staff, all students (district wide), all students with blank usernames (district wide), all teachers (district wide), all staff (district wide), all teachers with blank usernames (district wide), or all staff with blank usernames (district wide). 
    Note: You can also invoke mass student synchronization from the Functions menu after establishing a selection of students. Similarly, you can invoke mass teacher/staff synchronization from the Functions menu after establishing a selection of teachers and/or staff. 
    Once a selection is established and the LDAP Directory Synchronization process is selected, one of two pages appears, depending on whether you are working with students or teachers and staff. In either case, before the synchronization process begins, the expected user ID attribute displays, and you have the opportunity to change it before proceeding. The User ID attribute is the name of the schema element in the LDAP directory that holds the username. This is the value that is brought back into PowerSchool and stored in the appropriate username field in PowerSchool's database 



3. Click Submit. When you click submit, the synchronization process begins and each record in the selection is processed. The first and last name in each record is used to find an exact match in the directory. If no exact match is found, a second search is done using only the last name in an effort to find partial matches.

If an exact match is found, the username in PowerSchool's database is compared to the username reported by the directory. If they are the same, no action is taken. If they differ, the value from the directory is stored in PowerSchool. All matching records are reported in the first section of the Synchronization Results.

When processing an exact match for a teacher/staff record, the following logic applies. If the record represents a teacher, the Teacher Username will be checked and updated if necessary. And, if the teacher has access to the admin portion of PowerSchool, the Admin Username is also checked. If the record represents a staff member, the Admin Username is checked and updated if necessary.

If partial matches are found, a list of the partial matches will be displayed in the exception portion of the Synchronization Results. A link will also be provided next to the record, which opens in a new browser window to allow manual lookup and synchronization. 

Records with no matches (either exact or partial) are reported in the exception portion of the Synchronization Results. For records with no matches, the appropriate users should be added to the LDAP directory or the first and last names should be checked to ensure that they match in PowerSchool and the Directory. Once the issue is corrected, the synchronization process can run again."

"# Password Rules Management

With the introduction of Password Rules Management, PowerSchool now provides PowerSchool administrators the ability to configure various rules that are applicable when Students, Admins and Teachers, and Parents establish and maintain their passwords, including:

* Password Complexity Rules
* Password Expiration Rule
* Password Reuse Rule
* Account Lockout Rule



When using PowerSchool SIS as an Identity Provider (IdP), there are additional restrictions on Password Rules Management configuration:

* The Account Lockout Rule cannot be disabled.
* Passwords must be unique from a database of well-known passwords.

Password Rules Management and Student Password Management only show settings when using PowerSchool as the IdP.

Once Password Rules Management is configured, Password Rules Management functionality appears throughout the PowerSchool SIS Admin portal, the PowerSchool SIS Student and Parent portal, the PowerSchool SIS Teacher portal, and PowerTeacher Administrator.

Upgrading PowerSchool
---------------------

When upgrading, Password Rules Management is automatically set to the following default values for students, admins and teachers, and parents:

* Password Complexity Rules (Minimum characters) – Set to 1 for students, admins, and teachers. Set to 6 for parents.
* Password Complexity Rules (Password contains) – Disabled.
* Password Expiration Rule – Disabled.
* Password Reuse Rule – Disabled.
* Account Lockout Rule – 20.

Once you have configured Password Rules Management, subsequent upgrades will preserve your configurations.

During the upgrade, user account data is migrated into the new Password Rules Management PCAS tables. All Administrator-defined and user-defined passwords are converted to a hash as part of this process. Once the upgrade is completed, a comma-delimited file is created in the PowerSchool logs folder (the same folder containing pslog.txt and dalx.log) called PCAS\_Migrate.csv. The file only contains errors and modified usernames. If the file appears empty, all accounts migrated successfully and without change. To open the file, use a spreadsheet application, such as Excel. The file displays original usernames, new usernames where the original usernames had to be modified, and any errors that were encountered during the migration. Possible errors include:

* Failed to migrate: Indicates that the account could not be migrated for unexpected reasons.
* Truncated password to 40 characters: Indicates that the user's password was too long for an admin-entered password and has been truncated to the first 40 characters of the password.
* Failed Rename in Legacy Table (PCAS and Legacy out of sync!): Indicates that the new username was created in PCAS, but was not copied back over to the legacy table overwriting the original username; as a result, the user will not be able to sign in; therefore, manually change the user's username via the appropriate PowerSchool page.

If you are unable to identify a user by their username, the DCID value for that particular row in the appropriate table is given; you can use the DCID value to bring up the matching record in USM.

Using the information provided, you can notify users who usernames had to be modified (user names are modified to prevent duplicate user names from migrating to the new Password Rules Management PCAS tables, as well as to troubleshoot any data migration issues.

Installing PowerSchool
----------------------

When installing, Password Rules Management is automatically set to the following default values for students, admins and teachers, and parents:

* Password Complexity Rules (Minimum characters) – Set to 7.
* Password Complexity Rules (Password contains) – Enabled.
* Password Expiration Rule – Set to 60 days.
* Password Reuse Rule – Set to 5.
* Account Lockout Rule – Set to 5."

"# PowerSchool SIS SSO

The PowerSchool SIS supports the following methods of Single Sign-On:

* PowerSchool SIS as OIDC Service Provider for SSO
* PowerSchool SIS as SAML Service Provider

PowerSchool SIS as an Identity Provider
---------------------------------------

You can administer single sign-on to allow users to sign in to other PowerSchool products by configuring PowerSchool SIS as an identity provider (IdP)."
"# PowerSchool SIS as SAML Service Provider

PowerSchool can be configured as a SAML service provider for single sign-on, which allows authorized users can use the PowerSchool SIS Admin portal, the PowerSchool SIS Teacher portal, and the PowerSchool SIS Student and Parent portal as the central location from which to access their PowerSchool systems with a single set of credentials. For information about creating a SAML Service Provider plugin in order to configure the PowerSchool SIS as a SAML Service Provider, see the PowerSchool as a SAML Service Provider section of the PowerSchool Developer Site.

To set up PowerSchool SIS as SAML Service Provider, perform the following setup items in the order by which they appear.

### Step 1: Enable SAML Service Provider

Use the Plugin Management Dashboard to enable the SAML Service Provider plugin. Enabling the plugin establishes the PowerSchool SIS as a SAML service provider.

1. From the start page, choose System.
2. Select System Settings.
3. Select Plugin Management Configuration.
4. Select Enable/Disable next to the SAML Service Provider plugin that was previously installed. 

5. Click Enable. 

### Step 2: Configure SAML Service Provider

Use the SAML Service Provider Setup page to configure the settings needed for establishing a successful SSO connection between an identity provider and the PowerSchool SIS as the service provider.

1. From the start page, choose System.
2. Select System Settings.
3. Select Plugin Management Configuration. 
4. Select the plugin name for the SAML Service Provider plugin that was previously installed.
5. Click SAML Service Provider.
6. In the External Identity Provider Settings section: 

    1. Enter the external identity provider's public URL for Entity ID.

    2. Enter the service provider's Metadata URL. The value is supplied by the service provider, which allows the IDP to communicate with the service provider application.

    3. Click View IDP Metadata to view the external identity provider's IDP Metadata, which must match what is stored in the PowerSchool SIS. This information can be used to diagnose communication issues.

7. In the Local Service Provider Settings section, enter the local service provider's name.

8. In the Advanced SAML Service Provider Settings:
    1. Enter the Assertion Subject NameIdentifier to change the attribute PowerSchool SIS evaluates from the SAML Response. By default, PowerSchool SIS uses the authenticationId attribute from the SAML response to access the state-id or psguid value. When this value is blank authenticationId is used.

    2. Select Enable forceAuth if your SAML IdP supports forceAuth and has a long assertion lifespan. When enabled, PowerSchool SIS will force re-authentication against the SAML IdP if the SAML assertion is no longer valid.

9. Click Save.

### Step 3: Enable SAML Authentication

Use the SAML Authentication Setup page to enable SAML single sign-on, which allows authorized users to use the PowerSchool SIS Admin portal, the PowerSchool SIS Teacher portal, and the PowerSchool SIS Student and Parent portal as the central location from which to access their PowerSchool systems with a single set of credentials.

1. From the start page, choose System.
2. Select SAML Authentication Setup. 
3. To enable SAML Single Sign-On for PowerSchool, select Enable SAML Authentication for Admin Users.
4. To enable SAML Single Sign-On for the PowerSchool SIS Teacher portal, select Enable SAML Authentication for Teacher Users
5. Click Submit. "
"# Co-Teaching
On this page:



Co-Teaching allows PowerSchool administrators to assign multiple lead teachers, as well as additional staff or teachers to a section. The teacher-of-record is the lead teacher, and other staff or teachers are the additional teachers.

The administrator can select additional teachers, indicating the role, the percent allocation to the role, the start and end dates, and an optional note for each teacher.

A Section Teachers icon displays with a shared section on the Quick Lookup, Bell Schedule, and Modify Schedule pages to alert you that more than one teacher shares a section.

If a section is shared between multiple teachers, teachers can generate section-specific reports even if they are not the lead teacher of a section. Some System Reports in PowerSchool will display section and teacher association data. Refer to System Reports for more information."
"# Co-Teaching Roles
PowerSchool comes with default roles, which should be sufficient for most configurations. If additional roles are needed, you can set up roles with the necessary access to the PowerSchool SIS Teacher portal.

After you define the roles, you can assign the roles to teachers and staff in the affected section. For more information, refer to Assign Teachers to a Section.

Use Co-Teaching roles to manage the level of access given to teachers who access the PowerSchool SIS Teacher portal. By default, there are four predefined roles that you can assign to teachers: Lead Teacher, Co-Teacher, Teacher Aide, and Observer. You can edit or delete any of these roles except for the Lead Teacher role. You can create as many roles as needed according to your district's needs.

Use the Co-Teaching Roles page to review a chart that displays each role and the assigned properties.

"# User Access Roles
On this page:



User Access Roles provide PowerSchool administrators with the ability to create roles specifically for their system's use. User Access Roles control user access to PowerSchool or external applications, such as PowerSchool Independent Software Vendor (ISV) systems. When a role is created, you can assign a PowerSchool security group to that role. This role can then be used to override the default security group for a user within a specific school context.

Note: There are two types of User Access Roles: Roles with a PowerSchool security group associated to them, and roles without a security group. Typically, roles created without a PowerSchool security group associated to them are the roles used to uniquely identify a user to an external application. Roles without a PowerSchool security group associated to them can be simply labels, or they can have field-level security or document attachment access restrictions. If they are simply labels, they provide flexibility in identifying the user to an external system, but they do not affect the users access within PowerSchool. Roles with a PowerSchool security group associated to them directly control the access the user has within PowerSchool.

It is important to understand that the security group is the backbone of a role that is used for PowerSchool access. A role that has a PowerSchool security group can be used to override a user's default security group for any school affiliation. Users can have multiple role/group combinations for each of their schools, but can only have one default security group. If a user has no roles with a PowerSchool security group, PowerSchool recognizes the user's default security group.

For more information on assigning roles, see Staff Security Settings."
"# Pre-Seeded User Access Roles
PowerSchool includes several pre-seeded or pre-defined user access roles. None of these pre-seeded roles have a PowerSchool security group associated with them, and all of them were created to assist with single sign-on (SSO) integration between PowerSchool and other systems.

As of PowerSchool 10.0.1, the following pre-seeded User Access Roles have been added: Assessment Teacher, SPED Teacher, and LMS teacher. By default, any user with an existing sign-in to the PowerSchool SIS Teacher portal will have these roles assigned to them. These roles were created to support SSO integrations between PowerSchool Group's portfolio of products. Should your district or school have more than one PowerSchool product, you can enable SSO between the PowerSchool SIS and other PowerSchool products. With SSO enabled, the SSO links within the PowerSchool SIS Teacher portal will display for any user who has the corresponding user access role for that product.

Should you want to remove a user's access to the PowerSchool product SSO links in the PowerSchool SIS Teacher portal, you can remove the corresponding user access from that user. Without the corresponding user access role, the SSO link for that product is hidden from the user.

To add or remove user access roles from a selected group of users, see Mass Assign User Access Roles to Selected Group of Users.# Create a User Access Role

Using the Mass Assign/Remove User Access Roles function, you can assign or remove roles to multiple teachers or staff members. Be sure to review the security settings for the roles you want to mass assign to ensure you are providing the correct security settings for each staff member.

Notes:

* User Access Roles with and without an associated PowerSchool security group may be assigned to a user at any given time. Typically, user access roles with a PowerSchool security group associated with them are assigned to control the user's access within PowerSchool. User access roles without a PowerSchool security group associated with them are used to identify the user to an external application, such as a PowerSchool Independent Software Vendor (ISV) system.
* When a user has a default access group assigned at a school, that default will be overwritten by the mass-assigned user access roles. A user with existing user access roles will not have those roles overwritten during the mass assignment. Additional roles that are mass assigned to the user will be added to their existing list of roles. When accessed at the district level, user access roles with a PowerSchool security group associated with them are only assigned to users at the schools they already have access to within PowerSchool.
* When accessed at the district level, user access roles without a PowerSchool security group associated with them are assigned to users at all the schools that have been selected, regardless of whether or not the user has access to that school within PowerSchool. This gives the external system the option to permit users more flexibly, and not be constrained by the user's PowerSchool access.

"# Field Level Security
On this page:



The Field Level Security feature provides easy-to-use tools for the PowerSchool Administrator to configure and manage field-level security for PowerSchool SIS Admin and PowerSchool SIS Teacher fields that need to be limited. Users can be granted Full Access, View Only, or No Access to specific fields. It helps accomplish the following goals:

* Protect PII (Personally Identifiable Information) so that unauthorized users cannot see or access it.
* Protect data integrity by limiting who can edit specific fields, even though some other users may need to view the information.

Note: For more information about common usage scenarios and provides details on how to use FLS in customizations by utilizing DATs, lists, and conditional statements, see Knowledgebase article 71873."
"# Page Level Security vs. Field Level Security
Field Level Security is not a substitute for Page Level Security, but rather complementary to it. Users are never given more access than is granted at the page level. For example, if a user has Field Level Security set to ""Full Access"" on a particular field, but the page is set to ""View Only"" for that user, then the user will only be granted ""View Only"" access to the field on that page. Since Page Level Security only affects a single page, it is possible for a user to have full edit access on another page for the same field. There are some pages in PowerSchool that do not enforce FLS. These pages should continue to be secured through Page Level Security where possible:

* Autosend
* Import
* Family Management
* ReportWorks
* Reports utilizing the SRP platform. 

    Note: The SRP security mechanism can be used to secure these reports. 



* Reports utilizing the Reporting Engine where fields are called without DATs
* Health 

    Note: The health module has feature-level security in the Security Group settings. 



* New Student Enrollment
* Transfer Out of School/Transfer Student Out# User Access Roles
User Access Roles are required to take advantage of Field Level Security. By themselves, roles are nothing more than a label. It is what you do with a role that gives it meaning in PowerSchool. Roles are very powerful tools allowing you to setup advanced security scenarios when mixed with Security Groups, Page Level Security and FLS. Users can have multiple roles tied to each of their school affiliations accommodating unique security configurations. All security roles are additive, meaning that for any particular setting users are given the highest level of access granted to any of their roles. For example, if a user has a role configured for No Access to the SSN field, but they have another role configured for View Only access, the effective security on SSN will be View Only.

Other Important Notes:

* It is not recommended to set name fields to No Access. However, it is okay to secure name fields as View Only to prevent editing, but names will not be fully protected from displaying, as they are necessary for PowerSchool to function properly. Additionally, the ^(lastfirst) DAT will not be protected.
* There are some special purpose pages where users will still be able to view data even if their field access level is set to No Access. System administrators are expected to utilize Page Level Security to restrict access to these pages. For a current list of the specific areas that do not enforce field level security, see Knowledgebase article 71873.
* Existing tlist\_sql tags used in custom pages that do not include the new FLS method tags will not be secured until they are updated with these new keywords. It is advised that you update any tlist\_sql tags on custom pages that you need to be secure by FLS. For more information, see Knowledgebase article 71873.
* Many Student Contacts fields are stored in another table and synced with the Students table (for example, Students.Emerg\_Phone\_1 is synced with PhoneNumber.PhoneNumberAsEntered). In these cases, the FLS rules for these fields are defined on the source table (PhoneNumber.PhoneNumberAsEntered) and not the synced table. For a complete list of Student Contact fields that are synced from other source tables, see Knowledgebase article 71873."

"# Plugin Security

The Plugin Security section of the \[Field Name\] drawer displays the plugin roles that have been granted access to the selected field. Access to the field by a plugin can only be approved or rejected by a PowerSchool Administrator when a plugin is enabled. If you need to change a plugin's access to a specific field, you must work with the plugin developer to change the field access list within the plugin xml.

When the \[Field Name\] drawer only displays the Plugin Security section and does not also display the User Access Security section, this indicates that the field is not a core Field Level Security field that can be secured using User Access roles. Fields of this type are only secured to plugins when those plugins are enabled, and have been granted access to the field by a PowerSchool Administrator.

For more information on a plugin's access to specific fields and how these fields are listed within the plugin xml, see the Plugin Management and the PowerSchool Developer Site.

"# Security Permissions

In PowerSchool, system users are considered staff members. All PowerSchool system users must be added as staff members before you can assign security permissions. When adding new staff members, you can assign permissions, as needed. Additionally, you can assign permissions by user group or set permissions at the page level. For more information about assigning permissions by user group, see Group Security Permission.

When user permissions are enabled for ReportWorks, the user account is shared. Therefore, the username and password are the same for the PowerSchool SIS Admin portal and Report Works. Due to the shared account, the PowerTeacher Administrator and ReportWorks applications cannot run simultaneously. Be sure to set appropriate PowerSchool group and page permissions for these users. For more information, see Edit a Staff Member Security Settings and Set Page-Level Permissions.

"# Role Assignments
On this page:



Assigning a role provides you with the flexibility to set different security group access at different schools, or to create a user account for only external systems, such as features added through the Plugin Management Dashboard. Assigning a role is not required if you do not want the user account to have different group security at different schools.

You can assign a different level of the administrative portion of PowerSchool user access for each school affiliation by assigning different roles. Roles are assigned on the Security Settings page. For more information on setting up roles, see Roles Administration.

Important Note: At least one role must be associated with a Security Group in order to allow a user to switch to that school. When multiple Roles/Security Groups are added to a school, the users effective security permissions will be the highest level granted for all groups tied to a school. For example, if Group 1 allows access to Historical Grades, and Group 2 allows access to Demographics, then the user will have access to Historical Grades and Demographics. Furthermore, if Group 1 allows View Only access to Historical Grades, and Group 2 allows Modify Access to Historical Grades, then the user will receive Modify Access to Historical Grades. In addition, if a security group is removed from a role that has been assigned to a user, the user's Default Group will become their effective security group (if it was their only role for a particular school). This allows the user uninterrupted access to the school until a role can be added that does have a specific security group."

"# Run the Teacher Schedule Report

The Teacher Schedule Report allows you to produce and print teacher schedules for the current year with page breaks between teachers. Though this report can be viewed with Safari for Mac OS X and Microsoft Internet Explorer for Windows, other browsers may not appropriately display the report formatting.

Tips for printing this report:

* Enable the printing of backgrounds. Shading and colorations in reports are all considered backgrounds. Not printing backgrounds may lead to illegible printouts.
* Turn off the printing of header information in your browser settings. If this is not off, each page printed may include the URL of this page, a page number, and a time stamp. These are generally not desired for this report.
* Use your browser's Print Preview function to confirm that the output is correct prior to sending it to the printer. You may adjust text size using the text font size controls of your browser. You may also control the page orientation using your browser settings to fix table cells that span page breaks or reports that print too small.

Whether working with an individual student or a group of students, PowerSchool makes it is easy for administrators to manage students and their information."
"# Create a New School Enrollment

Create a new school enrollment to record a change in a student's status without exiting or re-enrolling the student. When using this function to create a new enrollment, a previous enrollment is created simultaneously, which is especially helpful in situations where a student's enrollment information (such as the track or district of residence) changes midway through the school year. By creating a new school enrollment, the previous and current information are saved as two separate enrollments. This result is particularly beneficial for reporting purposes.

Information in the exit-related fields is saved as a ""reenrollments"" record that will be created and filled with the information from the student's current enrollment and will become the student's previous enrollment. The remaining fields (other than any state-specific fields that may appear at the bottom of the page) define the student's current enrollment.

1. On the start page, select the school you want to create a new enrollment.
2. Search for and select the student.
3. Under Enrollment, choose Functions from the student pages menu.

Most of the pages you work with are the same for all of the schools that use PowerSchool. However, some pages can be modified to meet your school's individual needs. This function is noted in the appropriate sections. If a section does not indicate that a page can be customized for your school, it is a PowerSchool preconfigured page that cannot be modified.

When reading descriptions of the modifiable pages, keep in mind that either the page itself can be modified by your PowerSchool administrator or the data in the fields on the page can be modified by the PowerSchool user. For example, a page might provide fields for only a student's name and phone number. As the user, you can modify the data in those fields if the information is wrong or has changed. However, if you want the page to provide a student's address in addition to a name and phone number, your PowerSchool administrator must modify the page to add the address field.

Each student page view section assumes that you have selected an individual student record. For more information, see Student Search."
"# Work with Students

When you select a student, PowerSchool displays the Student Pages menu. From this menu, you can manage the student record in a variety of ways. The items on the Student Pages menu do not necessarily follow a particular sequence; therefore, use this section as a reference and review those sections that you need for a given task."
"# Students Historical Grades
On this page:

Student grade records in PowerSchool includes two types of grades: current and historical.

Current grades are students' grades entered by each of their teachers through PowerTeacher Pro Gradebook. Current grades change with each new assignment that teachers enter into the gradebook. Teachers, administrators, and parents use current grades to track student progress throughout a grading term and are most easily seen on the Quick Lookup student page.

Historical grades are final grades or grades that are permanently stored in the student's record. At the end of each grading term, your PowerSchool administrator copies and stores the students' current grades from teachers' gradebooks to historical grades. Historical grades appear on report cards and transcripts.

The Historical Grades student page displays your selected student's grades from previous terms. You have the choice of using a normal view or a detail view.



Note: The Historical Grades student page view is view-only for most users; only those with proper access, such as a school counselor, have the right to edit historical grades. Teachers who assign grades and need to change them later must contact a user with the proper access."

        Note: Grade Suppression Code only appears if Repeated Course Grade Suppression is enabled for the selected school. For more information, see Repeated Course Grade Suppression. 
        Note: Your school can create credit types to group courses together to fill a graduation requirement. Assign credit types to courses or final grades and then specify that a requirement be filled by any courses or grades of that credit type. For example, you specify that any two courses with the ALGEBRA credit type fulfill a math requirement.

"# Summer School

On this page:

This section outlines the process for implementing summer school within a PowerSchool district. As of 10.1.4, an updated approach to Summer School is supported along with the original method, used in versions prior to 10.1.4. These differences will be noted in the documentation where needed. The updated approach will be referred to as the Remote Enrollment method, while the original method will be referred to as the Direct Enrollment method. As you are reading through this document, be sure you are referencing the correct Summer School method you have chosen to use for your school throughout the entire process.

Choosing an Approach for Summer School
--------------------------------------

PowerSchool supports two approaches to Summer School, the Direct Enrollment method and the Remote Enrollment method. Depending on the needs of your specific school, one method may be a better fit than the other. It is important to know the differences since you will need to stay consistent with the chosen method throughout the entire process.

Direct Enrollment
-----------------

The Direct Enrollment method is the only method available to PowerSchool versions prior to 10.1.4. Direct Enrollment requires that students are transferred directly to the Summer School, where they are processed and handled the same as if they were attending the Summer School as their primary school enrollment. This method requires that the End-of-Year (EOY) process is not run prior to the completion of the Summer School term.

Remote Enrollment (Recommended)
-------------------------------

The Remote Enrollment method is a new method available to PowerSchool version 10.1.4 and greater. Remote Enrollment allows students to remain enrolled in their home school while the Summer School manages students as if they are remote students. This method creates a Re-Enrollment record for keeping track of the Summer School Enrollment without affecting their home (or Current) enrollment. This is the recommended approach since it has the advantage of not disrupting normal home school operations and allows the End-of-Year process to be run at any time.

Fees, Direct Enrollment vs. Remote Enrollment
---------------------------------------------

One notable difference between Direct Enrollment and Remote Enrollment is the way fees are assessed. Fees are normally tied to a student's home school. Remote schools can assess student fees directly to the student, but School enrollment fees are not available. Course enrollment fees are assessed when a student enrolls into a remote section, however, the charge will only show at the home school.

Storing Grades, Direct vs. Remote Enrollment
--------------------------------------------

Another difference between Direct Enrollment and Remote Enrollment is how storing grades is handled. For Direct Summer School Enrollment, grades are stored at the Summer School, after which the DDA (Direct Database Access) tool is used to change the School ID on stored grades to match the students' home school. Remote Enrollment does not require the School ID to be changed when storing grades. However, the stored grades process must be initiated from each student's home school using very specific settings. For more information, see Storing Grades.

Attendance Reports for Summer School
------------------------------------

When using Direct Enrollment or Remote Enrollment, attendance reports can be run as normal. 

Example: Navigate to the List Students group function after making a selection of students from the start page. Enter DA in one of the columns to display the full year of attendance based on the selected year context. Other attendance Data Access Tags will work as well. For more information, see the Data Access Tags Supplement available on PowerSource.

PowerScheduler for Summer School
--------------------------------

The summer school setup as outlined does not impact the use of PowerScheduler, assuming that all student indicators are set correctly, and the process outlined in this document is followed in order."
"# Summer School Process Outline

The following chart provides a chronological listing of the steps included in this document and any associated time constraints. Print this chart and use it to keep track of the summer school process.

Note: Start this process at any time throughout the current school year. The steps are chronological and must be followed in order, noting any associated time constraints.

Direct Enrollment Only: Students must be transferred from the active school to the summer school after the last day of the active school year.

"# Assign Teachers to Summer School

On this page:

Once staff decisions have been made, assign teachers access to the summer school. From the staff member's home school, add the summer school to his or her affiliated schools using the Teachers and Affiliations tab on the Security Settings page. Mark the Staff Type as teacher for the staff member to appear on the list of teachers on Teacher Schedules page and so that the teacher can be assigned sections.

Assign Teachers to Summer School
--------------------------------

1. On the start page, search for and select a staff member. For more information, see Staff Search.
2. On the Staff page, click Security Settings from the staff pages menu. 
3. Click the Teachers and Affiliations tab.
4. On the Teachers and School Staff section, click Add on the School Affiliations row. 
5. Select the checkbox next to each summer school you want to add. 
    Note: You can also press SHIFT while selecting multiple schools, which automatically selects all schools between your first and last selection. 

6. Choose Teacher from the Staff Type pop-up menu.
7. Click OK. 
8. Click Submit. 

Once teachers have been assigned to a summer school, sections may be created and associated with them. For more information, see Course Sections.

Transfer Active Students Into Summer School(Direct Enrollment Only)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

1. On the start page, search for and select the group of students you wish to transfer to summer school. The Student Selection page appears. For more information, see Select a Group of Students.
2. Choose Transfer Out of School from the Select a function for this group of students pop-up menu. 
    Note: Alternatively, if you have a current selection of students, you can access this page by choosing Special Functions > Groups Functions. 

3. Enter an appropriate Date of Transfer and Exit Code. For field descriptions, see Transfer a Student Out of School.
4. Select the appropriate choice from Auto-Transfer School Options.

    * Choose Transfer to the Summer School set on each student (recommended) if you wish to transfer students to their designated summer school based on their selected summer school indicator. This option will allow you to later use the Transfer to the last enrolled school option after summer school to return the student to their original school before running the End-of-Year process.
    * Choose Transfer to \[school\] if you wish to ignore the summer school indicator for each student and instead transfer those students to a specific school.
5. Select Check here if student(s) intend to enroll in school during next school year to preserve the students' future scheduling information for the current school including course requests and next school indicator.
6. Click Submit. 
    Note: The students' status is now inactive. From now on, when you want to open the student records, you must enter a forward slash (/) before the students' last name when entering it in the Student Search field. 
    If you know that the group is transferring to another school that shares your PowerSchool system, you must also transfer the records to that school before the students can be enrolled there. For more information, see Transfer to Another School. 



Search Commands for Transferred Students
----------------------------------------

Direct Enrollment: Once students are transferred out of the current school, they are re-enrolled into the applicable summer school. Use the search command line to find all of the summer school students and enroll them as a group.

The transferred-in special group selects all students who have been transferred in to this school but not yet enrolled in this school. In the search field, enter transferred-in and click the search button.

This command line searches for all students with enroll status of ""2"" (transfer out), where the SchoolID is the current school (transferred to this school) and where the Enrollment\_SchoolID is not the current school (transferred from another school to the current one).

However, students who have transferred to a new school then left the district, or students who were never enrolled also display in the search results. To narrow the search, use the ""search within results"" comparator, signified by a ""&"" prefix character. For example, enter &/ExitDate>=6/15/17 to display search results of all students transferred in to the summer school after 6/15/17. The ""/"" prefix used in conjunction with the ""&"" prefix includes students who are not currently enrolled. Without this prefix, as the original search of ""transferred-In"" explicitly excludes enrolled students, the search results would display no students."
"# Assigning Student Schedules (Direct Enrollment Only)

"# Final Grade/Reporting Term Setup

Define final grades/reporting terms for use within the PowerSchool SIS Teacher portal and the grade storing process. Typically, one final grade/reporting term is sufficient for tracking summer school grades. However, if multiple summer school sessions exist or if additional grade tracking during summer school is required, add final grades/reporting terms as needed.

Remote Enrollment method: The same final grade/reporting term name must exist at the Summer School and home school, for the relative terms. In most cases this will equate to a ""Y1"" final grade/reporting term created for the full year term of both the summer school and home school.

Add Final Grades/Reporting Terms
--------------------------------

1. On the start page, choose School from the main menu. 
2. Under Grading, click Final Grade/Reporting Term Setup.

"# Multiple Sequential Summer Schools (Direct Enrollment Only)

Some districts offer multiple ""sessions"" of summer school over the summer. In this case, a particular student could be enrolled at one summer school during the ""A"" term and a different summer school during the ""B"" summer term.

The notable side effects of this are:

1. Originating school transfer from the ""B"" term school will return the student to the ""A"" term school unless the student is transferred back to regular-term school between ""A"" and ""B"" terms.
2. There is only one summer school field per student, therefore both summer school sessions cannot be identified during the regular school year. The second summer school can be noted in the SummerSchoolNote field instead, and moved into the SummerSchoolID at some point after Term ""A"" starts.

Enroll Students in Sequential Summer Schools
--------------------------------------------

1. During the regular school year, create the summer school with the ""A"" term, and create another summer school for the ""B"" term. For more information, see Set Up Summer School. Note the SummerSchoolID for both schools.
2. On the student Scheduling Setup page, select the ""A"" term summer school on the Summer School selection menu. For more information, see Transfer Active Students Into Summer School.
3. After the end of the regular school year, transfer students into the ""A"" term summer school.
4. After transfers have been handled for ""A"" term, search for and select a student that is enrolling in sequential summer school sessions. On the student Scheduling Setup page, select the ""B"" term summer school on the Summer School selection menu. Repeat this step for each student enrolling in sequential summer school sessions. Do not transfer students until the ""A"" term is completed.
5. Once ""A"" term is completed, transfer all students back to their originating school. This is only necessary if the students need to be transferred back to the originating school prior to End-of-Year processing.
6. Prior to ""B"" term starting, transfer active students to the ""B"" term summer school.
7. Repeat for additional sequential summer terms."
"# Summer School Setup

The creation of a summer school is the same as the creation of the originating school:

* Create the school (district level)
* Define the years and terms (School Setup page)
* Set attendance preferences (School Setup page)
* Set FTE Codes (School Setup page)
* Create Attendance Conversions (School Setup page)
* Create Attendance Codes (School Setup page)
* Create the Calendar (School Setup page)
* Create Courses (School Setup page)"
"# Storing Grades for the Normal School Year

Note: Summer School grades will also be stored after the Summer School session has ended. This step is for storing grades for the normal school year prior to the start of Summer School.

Direct Enrollment: Before transferring students to a summer school, initiate the Permanently Store Grades process to ensure that students' current final grade records are stored as historical data.

Remote Enrollment: Grades may be stored at any time prior to running the End-of-Year process. It is not necessary to store grades prior to enrolling students into Summer School sections when using the Remote Enrollment method.

For more information, see the Permanently Store Grades."
"# Storing Grades for Summer School

Upon the completion of the summer school term, use the Permanently Store Grades function to record the final grades as historical records

Direct Enrollment: Initiate Store Grades process from Summer School. The normal process for storing grades may be used, followed by the Transfer Stored Grades procedure described later in this section.

Remote Enrollment: Initiate Store Grades process from the student's active school with the following considerations:

* The selected term context must match the same school year as the TermID of the summer school year so that the correct Final Grade/Reporting Terms are available.
* Important: Under Exclude/Include Class Enrollments, select the option labeled Include only enrollment records that are currently active and that were active on this date:
    * Select a date that is toward the end of the summer school session and outside of normal school year dates, Otherwise previously stored grades for the home school may be stored again.
* Select the Store grades for classes enrolled at: All Schools so that remote summer school enrollments are included.
* Select the desired option for Record the school name of to indicate whether the home school or summer school name should be stored with the grades.
* Under Classes by term length you may need to select Yes for Show all terms?.

Note: It is important that Classes by term length is showing terms with the same year ID as the summer school session. If you are unsure of the year ID for either the normal school or the summer school then you can check user Start Page > School > Years & Terms >

Edit Terms, then click the name of the year long term. The year ID used by the system is the unlabeled number at the bottom of the page.

Important: If the summer school session has the term ID for the next year and you need to store grades for the current year, you will need to change the Default term level on the District > Miscellaneous page to Next School Year. This setting can be returned to its normal setting after grades are stored."
"# Tasks to Complete Prior to Summer School
On this page:"
"# Store Grades
Direct Enrollment: Before transferring students to a summer school, perform the Permanently Store Grades process to ensure that students' current final grade records are stored as historical data. For more information, see Permanently Store Grades in the PowerSchool online help.

Remote Enrollment: No change.# Run Reports
Direct Enrollment: Prior to the student transfer process, complete all reporting (including state reports) on students enrolling in summer school. Once the transfer to summer school is complete, the student record is associated with the summer school and the values from the previous enrollment become historical. Therefore, reporting capabilities are limited. 
Remote Enrollment: No restriction."
"# Assign Teacher Sections
Once you have assigned teachers to a summer school, you can create course sections and assign the teachers to their sections. On the Start Page, under Setup, click School. Then, click Sections. On the list of courses on the right, click the course for which you want to create a summer school section. Complete the Edit Section page, including selecting a teacher for the new section.# Set Student Indicators
Direct Enrollment Only: It is critical to set the four student-indicator values correctly for each student before transferring active students to summer school.

Direct and Remote Enrollments: These values are used during scheduling with PowerScheduler and during the End-of-Year process to determine student school assignments and whether a student is promoted or demoted.

The four student-indicator values are:

* Summer School Indicator – This indicator represents the school a student will be enrolled in for the upcoming summer school session. When a school is set up as a Summer School, it uses this value to determine if a student should display in its search results.
* Next Year Grade – This indicator is used in conjunction with the Next School Indicator to determine what scheduling options are available to the student. It is also used during the End-of-Year process to determine what grade level the student will be assigned for the next school year.
* Year of Graduation – This indicator sets the Year of Graduation value for each student. Improper setting of this value may affect the scheduling process with PowerScheduler.
* Next School Indicator – This indicator represents which school a student will be enrolled in for the next school year. It is used in conjunction with the Next Year Grade indicator to determine which scheduling options are available to the student. During the End-of-Year process, this value is used to determine where to enroll the student for the next school year.

Make sure that all students that will be attending summer school have a Summer School Indicator selected on their Scheduling Setup page. On the start page, enter SummerSchoolID# in the Search Students field and press ENTER (Windows) or RETURN (Mac). Verify that all students intending to attend summer school are in the results.

Then, verify that these remaining three student-indicator values are in place. You can use the following search criteria to find any students who are missing any one of the values:

       Note: A search with no argument after the equals sign looks for students for whom the value is blank. Using the ""+"" symbol before a search argument adds the results to your current selection.

1. On the start page, enter Sched\_NextYearGrade= in the Search Students field and press ENTER (Windows) or RETURN (Mac). Any students missing this value appear.
2. On the start page, enter +Sched\_YearOfGraduation= in the Search Students field and press ENTER (Windows) or RETURN (Mac). Any students missing this value appear.
3. On the start page, enter +Next\_School= in the Search Students field and press ENTER (Windows) or RETURN (Mac). Any students missing this value appear.

Once you've found students for whom one or more of the fields are blank, go to the Scheduling Setup student page for each student and enter the correct values for Next Year Grade, Year of Graduation, and Next School Indicator.

Or, work with your selected group one grade at a time by using Select Students By Hand. Select all the students from one grade level and then change their records all at once by using the Student Field Value function.

One other way to enter the correct information is to use PowerSchool's Importing & Exporting feature to change the fields for all the students in the group at once instead of one student at a time or one grade level at a time."
"# Add District Information
Use Summer School Year setting to indicate which summer school sections should be available for scheduling. This will be either sections in the current year or sections in the next year.

1. On the start page, choose District under Setup in the main menu.
2. Under District Information, click District Info.
3. Use the Summer School Year pop-up menu to indicate whether summer school is part of the Previous school year or the Next school year so the appropriate sections will be available for enrolling students.
4. Click Submit."
"# Transfer Stored Grades (Direct Enrollment Only)

    Note: The value here needs to match the school name exactly to ensure that grades display correctly on student transcripts. 

16. Click Modify Selected Records.

The records are now associated with the students' originating school. Repeat this process for each summer school."
"# Transfer Students Back to Originating School (Direct Enrollment Only)

It is not necessary to transfer students back to their regular-term school. The End-of-Year process automatically moves the students from summer school to the pre-defined Next School and Next Grade. However, some schools may have the need to transfer students back to the regular-term school. At the end of summer school, transfer students back to the originating school before End-of-Year processing if applicable. For more information, see Transfer Out of School.

Note: The End-Of-Year process has been modified to not include students with a Student.SummerSchoolID value in order to support the new Remote Summer School Enrollment process. The Student.SummerSchoolID must be removed before running the End-Of-Year process when using the Direct Enrollment method. For more information, see. End-of-Year Process.

1. On the start page, search for and select the group of students you wish to transfer back to their original school. For more information, see Select a Group of Students.
2. Choose Transfer Out of School from the Select a function for this group of students pop-up menu. 
    Note: Alternatively, if you have a current selection of students, you can access this page by choosing Special Functions > Groups Functions. 

3. Enter an appropriate Date of Transfer and Exit Code. For field descriptions, see Transfer a Student Out of School.
4. Select the appropriate choice from Auto-Transfer School Options. 

    * Choose Transfer to the last enrolled school (different from current) for each student (recommended) if you wish to transfer each student back to the school they were enrolled in before summer school.
    * Choose Transfer to \[school\] if you wish to ignore the student’s previous school and instead transfer those student to a specific school.




5. Select Check here if student(s) intend to enroll in school during next school year to preserve the students' future scheduling information including course requests and next school indicator.
6. Click Submit. PowerSchool notifies you that the student has been transferred.

Note: If transferring students back to the originating school, you must re-enroll the student in the original (regular term) school prior to End-of-Year processing. Students who have been transferred back to the originating school but not fully enrolled in the school will not be affected by the End-of-Year process and will remain in the previous year school and previous year grade.

Students transferred to summer school retain their current grade level and are assigned the default FTE for the school and grade level. The previous school enrollment is moved to the ReEnrollments table in PowerSchool once the summer school enrollment process is complete.

Note: Individual student transfers may fail in the event of the following conditions:

* * Transferring out of summer school to originating school if there are no previous enrollment records or if the student has no previous enrollments at other schools in the district.
    * Re-enrolling in originating school if they are in a grade with no default FTE defined in the current school and if they are already currently enrolled in another school."
"# End-of-Year Process

To close out the recently completed school year and prepare for the upcoming school year, review the entire PowerSchoolend-of-year process, including the procedures that must be performed before actually executing the end-of-year function.

The end-of-year function performs the following:

* Validates that students have Next School set for the current year prior to running this function. If students do not have these values set, use the Set Next School Group Function to enter the values.
* Validates that a school year term for the next school year has been set up in all schools.
* Promotes, retains, or demotes students according to each students Next Grade Level.
* Transfers students from one school to another (in multi-school environments) according to each student's Next School Indicator.
* Graduates students from district if Next Grade Level is set to 99 and their Next School is set to 999999 (Graduating Students School).
* Sets each student's Exit Date according to the last day of the school year for that school.
* Sets the Next Grade for the new enrollment to the next highest grade level.
* Sets the Next School for the new enrollment to the current school for all students not in the highest grade at the school.
* Sets the Next School for the new enrollment to the school's default graduating school if student is enrolled in the school's Highest Grade.
* Carries forward lunch balances while clearing out all financial lunch activity records, including:
    * Removes all individual meal transactions (GLDetail records) for all students and staff members.
    * Moves the current balances for students and staff into the starting balance field. 
        Note: The end-of-year process does not change fee balances and transactions. 

* Removes all records of parental access to student records via Internet and telephone, including:
    * PhoneLog records
    * Sign In records
    * Bulletin records
* Removes DBLog records older than 365 days
* Copies Courses records to CoursesByYear Archive for the upcoming year.
* Copies Standards to the upcoming year, if not already copied.
* Copies Grade Formula and Calculations to the upcoming year, if not already copied.

Before using this function:

* Set up your next school year using valid dates for each school.
* Make sure the next year has been created at the District Office.
* Verify that students graduating from the district have their Next Grade Level set to 99 and their Next School set to 999999 (Graduating Students School).
* Shut your PowerSchool server down and make an export of your database. Then, store this backup in a safe place so it can be accessed if needed in coming years.
* If you want a separate, ASCII-export archive copy of your lunch transactions and/or historical grades, go to Export Data Archives (recommended).
* Run ""Perform EOY Validation"" process to make sure no validation errors occur.
* Be sure that the server is able to run uninterrupted (without being shut down) while this process runs through to completion (up to 4 hours).
* Note that this process is irreversible.

IMPORTANT: The End-of-Year process will assign students to an FTE for next year based on the ""Default for these Grades"" FTE option. Please ensure that FTEs exist for next year and that all grade levels have been tied to an FTE for next year, from the School Setup > Full-Time Equivalencies (FTE) > Edit FTE Code page(s). This should be done for all schools in the upcoming school year. If not done, students will not have a valid FTE for next year, and ADA calculations will be inaccurate unless FTEs are manually assigned.

"# Digital Certificate Management
On this page:

Digital Certificate Management provides you with a central location from which to manage digital certificates. A digital certificate is an attachment to an electronic message used for security purposes. The attachment, which contains a public key and a variety of other identification information, is used to encrypt and decrypt messages to protect them against third party tampering."
"# PowerSchool Certificates
PowerSchool uses two digital certificates to secure communication with your PowerSchool server. This includes the server certificate used to enable SSL and possibly the client certificate used to access secure web services on other systems.

The PowerSchool server certificate is stored in the keystore. The keystore is a repository where public/private key pairs are stored. The X.509 client certificate may also be stored here if it was issued with a private decryption key. Otherwise, it is stored in the truststore.

Note: For example, Verisign issues a server certificate that also serves as a X.509 client certificate. It contains three parts: the public encryption key, the private decryption key, and the X.509 client certificate. Because the client certificate was issued with a private key, it would be stored in the keystore. StartSSL.com and other providers offer free or low-cost X.509 client certificates that are primarily used to sign emails. These certificates are stand-alone and rely on the root certificate for the Certificate Authority to be trusted. Therefore, they would be stored in the truststore.

"# Import and Export Fitness Tests and Scales

On this page: 


Administrators can input and extract the fitness tests and scales needed by the district. These ensure that the tests and scales are accurate when calculating student results. 



The ability to import or export fitness tests and scales requires the necessary permissions to manage student fitness records. 

* * View provides export access.
    * View/Modify provides import access to create new tests.
    * View/Modify/Delete provides access to import overrides for existing tests.

Import Fitness Tests and Fitness Scales
---------------------------------------

Before tests and scales can be defined to be used in tracking student fitness, the tests and scales must first be imported using Data Import Manager. The template for the Presidential Fitness Test found on the PowerSchool Community can be used to import custom fitness tests into PowerSchool SIS.

Three new code sets have been created to import fitness tests and scales. 

* Test Label allows you to add metadata to the type of fitness being measured by the test type or subsets.
* Test Code allows you to set exception scores (for example, Non-Compliant or Medically Excused.)

* Test Unit sets the types of measures used for the fitness tests. 


### Data Sets

The Test data set establishes the broad overall fitness test (for example, the Presidential Physical Fitness Test) while the Test Score data set establishes the test types within the test (for example, One Mile Run or Curl Ups). 

To link tests and scales together, an import code must be created for the data set being imported. For example, each data set in the table below has a corresponding import code.

```
""Data Set "",""Name "",""Import Code ""
""Test "",""Presidential Physical Fitness Test "",""PPFT09 ""
""Test Score "",""Curl- Ups "",""PPFT09CU ""
""Fitness Scale Definition "",""Curl-Ups "",""PPFT09CU ""
""Fitness Code "",""High Fitness Zone "",""PPFT09CUZ ""
""Fitness Scale "",""Female Table "",""PPFT09CUF ""
```

Multiple tables can be created in the Fitness Scale data set. For example, when importing data sets for the Presidential Physical Fitness Test, you can create two tables for each test type, one for males and another for females. Alternately, these tables can be associated with multiple genders. For fitness scores to be calculated, all student genders need to be associated with a table for each fitness scale.

### Data Set Upload Order

You must upload the data sets in the following order:

1. CodeSets defines the new code sets necessary for Fitness Tracking to function.
2. Test creates the overall fitness test.
3. TestScore creates test types for the fitness test.
4. TestLabel (optional) sets the metadata for the fitness area of the test type.
5. FitnessScaleDefinition creates the name, test unit, and definition of each fitness scale.
6. FitnessCode sets the scale items or scores for each fitness scale.
7. FitnessScale creates different tables within the scale for use with genders.
8. FitnessScaleGender assigns genders to the fitness scale tables.
9. FitnessScaleItem sets the code assigned to a student for a result based on their age and assigned gender table.

### Importing Data Sets

"# Photo Management
On this page:

Using the Import Pictures function, you can manage student and/or staff photos making uploading or deleting photos fast and easy."
"# Mapping Type
Before uploading student or staff photos, you need to decide the mapping type. Mapping type indicates whether you will be using student and staff numbers or names in your mapping file. Mapping by student or staff number is performed at the district level. Whereas mapping by student or staff name is performed at the school level in order to reduce the risk of duplicating records. If mapping by student or staff name, individual zip files and mapping files will need to be created for each school for which you want to upload photos.# Mapping File
Once you have determined your mapping type, then you need to create a tab-delimited mapping text file. The mapping file is used to specify which columns in your mapping file correspond to which photos in your zip file. The information contained within the mapping file depends on you mapping type and can be obtained by exporting from the Students or Teachers table and including the applicable fields, such as Student\_Number, TeacherNumber, Last\_Name, First\_Name, etc.

If uploading student or staff photos using student or staff numbers, the mapping file must contain the following data: \[Student\_Number\] or \[TeacherNumber\] and \[File Name\]. Column headers are not required. For example:

```
""420101752"",""1.jpg""
""420103883"",""2.jpg""
""420101493"",""3.jpg""
""420101494"",""4.jpg""
```

If uploading student photos using student names, the mapping file must contain the following columns and data: Last\_Name, First\_Name, Middle\_Name (optional), and Grade\_Level (optional). Column headers are required for all columns except the last column containing the file name. For example:

```
""Last_Name"",""First_Name"",""Grade_Level"",""""
""davis"",""deanne"",""9"",""1.jpg""
""davis"",""teresa"",""9"",""2.jpg""
""deyo"",""karen"",""9"",""3.jpg""
""draper"",""catherine"",""9"",""4.jpg""
```

If uploading staff photos using staff names, the mapping file must contain the following columns and data: Last\_Name, First\_Name, and Middle\_Name (optional). Column headers are required for all columns except the last column containing the file name. For example:

```
""Last_Name"",""First_Name"",""""
""hunter"",""david"",""1.jpg""
""johnson"",""marla"",""2.jpg""
""lee"",""anthony"",""3.jpg""
""morris"",""sam"",""4.jpg""
```

"# School Map

You can upload a map of your campus that is visible to students using the PowerSchool Parent and Student Mobile apps. Add text to the map to allow students to search for specific information. For best results, use a PDF with a maximum files size of 1 MB.

Upload a School Map
-------------------

Upload a school map in PDF, JPEG, or PNG format. See the upload page for detailed information on recommended specifications.

1. On the start page, choose School under Setup in the main menu. 
2. Under General, click School Map.
3. Click Choose File (or Browse) to select the school map file.
4. Click Submit. 

Delete a School Map

2. Under General, click School Map. 
3. Click Delete School Map. "
"# Search Page Contents

On this page:

You can search for either whole strings, or you can specify a starting string and an ending string (<img src=""\`"">). You may use both search types in a query. If you specify starting and ending strings, they must be on the same line, separated with the accent character ( \` - it's right above the tab key). If you do not specify any search arguments, you simply get a list of each file in that directory.

The search direction affects how start and end strings are handled. If you search forwards, the search engine looks for an occurrence of the starting string, then finds the closest ending string. If you search backwards, the search engine looks for an occurrence of the ending string, then finds the closest starting string. Why would you want to search backwards? Suppose you want to get a list of all images used on pages. You might search for (""\`.jpg""). By searching backwards, we find '.jpg"" ' first, then look back to the closest double quote. If you searched forwards, your search results would begin with the first double quote on the page, then continue on to the first '.jpg"" '.

Results to return tells the search engine how many results to display. If you select unique values only (which is really most useful when specifying starting and ending strings), you will only receive one search result per successful query. If you select all occurrences, you will receive every successful query. Using the above example, if you specify 'Unique values only', the search results will list each unique image only once, regardless of the number of pages on which it is found. Otherwise, you will get a list of every file that contains that image.

Finally, your search results can either be sorted by the search result or the file path.

"# System Styles

System styles are used when creating custom reports. They include font, font size, and alignment. Use this page to add styles, edit styles, and set style defaults.

Fonts are an important part of how your custom reports look. Perhaps you like report titles to be in large, bold, capital letters. Or perhaps you prefer that footer text be small and italicized. PowerSchool provides several styles you can use so that you don't have to set these preferences each time. Or create new styles according to your own preferences and needs. If you do not want to create styles at this point, you can still create reports. For more information, see Report Cards.

"# Calendar
On this page:

Use Calendar Setup to view, edit, or set up your school's calendar for the current academic year. At the top of the page, the system displays the month you are currently viewing and the six months before and after it. While your school calendar displays information regarding when school is in session for users, the system uses the calendar and the prerequisites you define to calculate your school's ADA/ADM statistics that you report to your state.

Prerequisites

* Set up years and terms.
* Set up periods and days, either when setting up years and terms or by committing a master schedule.
* Set up attendance conversions.
* Set up bell schedules."
"# Set Up Calendar
Before the start of a school year, define each field for each date in that year. During the school year, you might need to edit or update your school's calendar. For example, at the beginning of the year, assume you define a normal bell schedule for January 5. On that date, a snowstorm causes a two-hour delay and students are not able to make it to their first two periods. You can change the bell schedule and membership value you originally defined for the date and enter a note to explain the circumstances. By changing the bell schedule for that day, you can either remove the first two periods from that day or shorten all the periods for the day.

1. On the start page, choose School under Setup in the main menu. 
2. Under Calendaring, click Calendar Setup. 
3. Click a month to view its calendar. For example, click 3/15 to view the calendar for March of 2015.

    ""Membership Value"",""Enter the attendance value students receive if they are present in school on this date.""
    ""Tracks In-Session"",""If your school uses multiple student tracks, select the checkboxes for the tracks for which school is in session on this date.Note: If your school uses tracks, determine which students are on Track A and which students are on Tracks B, C, D, E, and F.

"# Set Up Bell Schedules
Set up bell schedules to correlate periods with the times that the periods meet and to determine which periods are taught on which calendar days. When setting up your school calendar, you can associate different bell schedules to different days of the year. For example, set up a bell schedule called Assembly, where each period meets for a shorter amount of time to accommodate a school event that day.

You must first set up attendance conversions to properly calculate attendance. For more information, see Attendance Conversions.

Note: Do not set up bell schedules until after you commit your master schedule. If you set up bell schedules and then re-commit a master schedule, the bell schedules lose their references to the schedule periods. Without this reference, you cannot take attendance. For more information about committing your master schedule, see When to Commit the Master Schedule.

1. On the start page, choose School under Setup in the main menu.
2. Under Calendaring, click Bell Schedules.
3. Click New. 
4. Enter a name for the bell schedule. For example, enter H or Half for half-day schedules.

5. Choose the attendance conversion from the pop-up menu. For more information, see Attendance Conversions. The number of periods in the attendance conversion must not exceed the number of periods in the bell schedule.

"# Years and Terms
On this page:

Define years and terms for your school. Years and terms affect many aspects of PowerSchool, such as the calendar setup, scheduling, enrollment, and final grades.

First, create the year term for your school. Then, define additional terms for the school year, if necessary.

Terms created on the Years & Terms page are ""scheduling terms,"" which define the entire length of a school year (year term) as well as the length of sections offered during the school year (semester, quarter, etc.). Classes offered during the school year determine the required scheduling terms. If students have the same teacher, room, and section throughout the year, only the year term is needed. However, if students change teachers, rooms, or sections throughout the year, create additional terms of varying lengths (semester, quarter, etc.).

Note: Scheduling terms differ from grading terms. For information about defining grading terms, see Final Grade Setup."

"# Family Management
On this page:

Family Management provides a streamlined approach to creating and understanding family relationships within PowerSchool. Identifying related students and the ability to share data among those students is the goal of family management, which allows schools to enter student data once and share data among family members.

Use family management to identify siblings or other students within the district who share the same demographic and guardian information. Once identified, shared data can be copied without additional data entry. Additionally, edited data can be dynamically updated for all students with the predetermined family relationship.

Family management provides districts with the flexibility to allow family associations across the district, or limited associations within just one school. If the scope of family management is limited to a single school, the student information cannot be associated or shared with students from other schools.

The Family Management function enables the district to:

* Control which student fields are copied from one student to another.
* Limit the scope of student records visible to a school administrator.
* Limit the scope of family associations to only those student records within the same school."

"# Entry and Exit Codes

Use entry codes to identify the reasons why students enroll in and transfer to your school. Use exit codes to identify the reasons why students leave your school.

Manage Entry and Exit Codes
---------------------------

District administrators can manage entry and exit codes using Code Sets. You can make an entry or exit code inactive by setting a future start date or an end date. This will allow the code to continue to show in reporting without allowing users to select an inactive code during the enrollment process."

"# Customizations

On this page:

Enabling customization allows you to save custom pages in an existing custom web\_root directory at PowerSchool\\data\\custom\\web\_root. The custom web\_root directory contains the same folder structure as the stock, non-custom PowerSchool web\_root at PowerSchool\\application\\components\\powerschool-core-{version\_number}\\system\\server\\resources\\web\_root.

To use custom pages and files, enable customization and store your custom pages and files in the appropriate subdirectory of the custom web\_root. When PowerSchool retrieves a page or file to display, it first checks the custom web\_root directory and directory structure. If found in the custom web\_root directory, the custom page loads. If it is not found in the custom web\_root directory, the page or file loads from the standard PowerSchool web\_root directory. Disable customization to ignore the custom web\_root directory and simply load pages and files from the standard PowerSchool web\_root directory.

Note: Any custom page placed in the standard web\_root will be overwritten when you update PowerSchool. Be sure to store such pages in the custom web\_root. 
Updating PowerSchool may cause the standard and custom web roots to differ in structure. For example, if a folder related to new functionality is created in the standard web\_root when updating the core PowerSchool application on your server, a folder of the same name in the same location needs to be created in the custom web\_root before you can store any custom pages related to that new function. If necessary, manually add or remove folders from your custom web\_root to mirror the standard web\_root. 

Enable Customization
--------------------

1. On the start page, choose System under Setup in the main menu. 
2. Under Server, click System Settings.
3. Click Customization. 
4. Select the Customization Enabled checkbox to prevent overwriting custom pages on your server when updating PowerSchool.

---------------------

1. On the start page, choose System under Setup in the main menu. 
2. Under Server, click System Settings. 
3. Click Customization.

    Note: If you have installed a plugin that requires customizations to be enabled, deselecting the checkbox will also disable the associated plugin. For more information, see Enable Plugins. 

5. Click Submit. "
"# Data Validation Settings

PowerSchool can validate data when submitting date and alphabetical field values. Data validation ensures that the day, month, and year for a date field is within a valid range and that an alphabetical field does not contain characters with ASCII codes between and including 1 and 31. If an invalid date is entered, PowerSchool sets the date to 00/00/00. If an invalid character in an alphabetical field is entered, PowerSchool deletes that character.

Note: In addition to enabling basic date validation, PowerSchool also recommends configuring field-specific data validation rules using Data Validation Configuration.

"# View the Outgoing Mail Queue
View any email messages sent to users from your PowerSchool server. The Outgoing Mail Queue page has two different formats, depending on whether PowerSchool is configured to use advanced email settings.

If the Use Advanced Email Settings switch on the Email Setup tab is Off, the outgoing email queue only shows the recipient's email address and only shows messages that are waiting to be sent. Normally, PowerSchool immediately sends email messages and, with advanced email settings disabled, the messages only show up on the outgoing mail queue page while waiting to be sent. However, communication failures cause messages to temporarily reside in the outgoing mail queue.

If the Use Advanced Email Settings switch on the Email Setup tab is On, the Outgoing Mail Queue has more capabilities. All messages sent by PowerSchool are listed, including messages already sent successfully.

"# Unified Classroom

Unified Classroom empowers teachers to manage the entire instructional process by connecting the classroom and home, combining PowerSchool student information system, assessment, learning, and gradebook products into a single, unified software solution. As part of the Unified Classroom onboarding process, PowerSchool Services will work with you to determine when Unified Classroom single sign-on (SSO) should be enabled. At your request, PowerSchool Services will enable Unified Classroom SSO for you. However, if you prefer, you can enable Unified Classroom SSO yourself using Allow Access to the Unified Classroom Setup Page and Enable and Configure Unified Classroom.

Before Getting Started
----------------------

* The Unified Classroom Setup page is only accessible at the district level for PowerSchool hosted customers with sufficient access privileges.
* When Unified Classroom is enabled, it relies on changes to Teachers/pw.html and public/pw.html. Districts who have customized the Sign In pages will need to update these pages with the latest changes before enabling Unified Classroom.
* When Unified Classroom is enabled, existing student, parent, and teacher usernames cannot be modified in both the PowerSchool SIS Admin portal and the PowerSchool SIS Student and Parent portal. If a username has not been entered, one may be entered. However, once submitted, it cannot be modified.

Allow Access to the Unified Classroom Setup Page
------------------------------------------------

In order to navigate to the Unified Classroom Setup page, you will need to provide Full permission to your Administrator group using the Overridden Page Permissions function. Using the Unified Classroom Setup page, administrators can quickly turn off Unified Classroom SSO completely or for specific portals. It is recommended that you only enable the permission for the Administrator group.

1. On the start page, choose System in the main menu.
2. Click Groups. 
3. Click a name in the Group Name column. 
4. Click Overridden Page Permissions.
5. Enter security/unifiedclassroom.html as the Filter.
6. Set all pages to Full.
7. Click Submit.

Enable and Configure Unified Classroom
--------------------------------------

1. From the start page, click School in the navigation toolbar, and then choose District Office.
2. Choose System in the main menu.

3. Click Unified Classroom Setup. 

4. Select Enable Unified Classroom Single Sign-On to enable Unified Classroom. When enabled, teachers, students, and parents will be able to sign in to Unified Classroom.

5. Select Enable Teachers Single Sign-On to redirect teachers to the Unified Classroom when they sign in to the PowerTeacher portal, and then click Yes.

6. Select Enable Students and Parents Single Sign-On to redirect students and teachers to the Unified Classroom when they sign in to the PowerSchool Student and Parent portal, and then click Yes.

7. Select Enable Automatic Account Creation for Parents to enable automatic Unified Classroom account creation for parents. When enabled parents added or updated in the SIS will automatically get a Unified Classroom account created. This only takes effect for any new parents added since the feature is enabled. It does not retroactively create an account for existing parents. If the district does need to retro-actively Unified Classroom accounts for parents, they must contact PowerSchool Support.

8. Unified Classroom External Hostname refers to the protocol, hostname, and port for the common portal URL. The default is set to https://classroom.powerschool.com/. This setting is only applicable if Enable Unified Classroom Single Sign-On is selected and you are in Test Server mode.

"# When to Commit the Master Schedule for Visual Scheduler

When your master schedule is as good as it can possibly be and school is no longer in session, commit the master schedule. When you commit a master schedule, it replaces any existing master schedule for that school year.

To ensure that attendance is set up properly, your ""live side"" school year should be created before committing your schedule in PowerScheduler. Also, when committing a master schedule, course information, including credit hours, is retrieved from the district level in PowerSchool.

Note: If you use PowerScheduler to create a master schedule, you should commit your master schedule before running the End-of-Year Process. The End-of-Year process modifies each student's Next School Indicator and Next Year Grade. If PowerScheduler is used after running the End-of-Year process, it is possible that students will be scheduled for the wrong school or grade level.

Commit the Master Schedule
--------------------------

1. On the start page, choose PowerScheduler under Applications in the main menu. 
2. Under Processing, choose Commit. 
3. Select which schedules to copy:
    * Sections Only: Select this option to commit only sections.
    * Student Schedules Only: Select this option to commit only student schedules.
    * Sections & Student Schedules: Select this option to commit both sections and student schedules.
4. Click Submit.
